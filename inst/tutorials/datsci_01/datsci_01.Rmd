## Getting Started

![](https://youtu.be/oEoInaLaB2s)

## Installing `r rproj()` and R Studio

Installing R

If you want to install `r rproj()` to work on your own computer, you can download it freely from the [Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN)](https://cran.r-project.org/). Note that CRAN makes several versions of `r rproj()` available:  versions for multiple operating systems and releases older than the current one. You want to read the CRAN instructions to assure you download the correct version. If you need further help, you can try the following resources:

- [Installing `r rproj()` on Windows](https://github.com/genomicsclass/windows#installing-r)
- [Installing `r rproj()` on Mac](http://youtu.be/Icawuhf0Yqo)
- [Installing `r rproj()` on Ubuntu](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu/README)

Installing RStudio

RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE). We highly recommend installing and using RStudio to edit and test your code. You can install RStudio through the [RStudio website](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/). Their [cheatsheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/rstudio-IDE-cheatsheet.pdf) is a great resource.  You need to install `r rproj()` first.

The content is discussed within the [textbook section on the R basics - 2.2.1 Objects](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/r-basics.html#objects).


## 1.2 Functions


![](https://youtu.be/wRr4hYuESeM)


### Textbook link

The content is discussed within the [textbook section on the R basics - 2.2.3 Objects](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/r-basics.html#functions).

### Key Points

1. Nested Functions: functions are evaluated from the inside out when you nest them 

2. Help Function:

    `help("log")`

    `?log`

3. Change natural log to log base 2

    `log(8, base =2 )`

    `log(8,2)`

4. Variable names 

    `solution_1 <- (-b + sqrt(b^2 - 4 * a * c)) / (2 * a)`

    `solution_2 <- (-b - sqrt(b^2 - 4 * a * c)) / (2 * a)`

### Code: Commenting your code

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Code to compute solution to quadratic equation of the form ax^2 + bx + c

# define the variables
a <- 3 
b <- 2
c <- -1

# now compute the solution
(-b + sqrt(b^2 - 4 * a * c)) / (2 * a)
(-b - sqrt(b^2 - 4 * a * c)) / (2 * a)
```

`class(murders)` 

`str(murders)`: shows the structure of the object “murders”

`head(murders)`: shows the first six lines of the data frame “murders”

`murders$population`: population column under “murders” dataset


**Numeric Vector: **

Pop <- `(murders$population)`

`length(pop)` : number of vectors in the column population 

`class(pop)`: numeric vectors 


**Characteric Vector:** 

`“a”`: character string 

`class(murder$states)`

**Logical vector:**

Must be true or false 

`==` is a relational operator 

**Factor: **

Useful to store categorical data 

`levels(murders$region)`

## 2.1 Vectors


![](https://youtu.be/PPq0yY7CeX4)


### Textbook link

The content is discussed within the [textbook section on the R basics - 2.6 Vectors](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/r-basics.html#vectors).

### Key Points:

**Creating Vectors**

- Use the function c which stands for concatenate: c(...)
- Use quotes so it’s character not variables 

country <- `c(“italy”, “canada”, “egypt”)` 

**Names** 

codes <- `c(italy =380, canada = 124, egypt = 818)`

OR

codes <- `c(380,124,818)`

country <- `c(“italy”, “canada”, “egypt”)`

`names(codes)` <- country 

**Sequences** 

`seq(1,10)`  = 1:10: the default is to go in increments of 1

`seq(1,10,2)` : increments of 2


**Subsetting** 

`codes[2]`

`codes[c(1,3)]` 

`codes[1:2]`

`codes[“Canada”]`

`codes[“egypt”,”italy”]`

### Textbook link

The content is discussed within the [textbook section on the R basics - 2.7 Coercion](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/r-basics.html#coercion).

### Key Points:

- When we put character string in the middle,  R converted numbers (1, 3) as character strings. 

x <- `c(1, "Canada",3 )`

- Turn numbber into characters

`as.character()`

- Turn characters into number

`as.numeric()`

### Textbook link

The content is discussed within the [textbook section on the R basics - 2.9 Sorting](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/r-basics.html#sorting).

### Key Points

- `sort(x)`: sort the original data 


- `order(x)`: the index that puts the sorted vector x in order 


- `rank(x)`: rank the original vector 

Example: 

x<- `c(31,4,15,92.65)`

`sort(x)` : sorted the original data

Index <- `order(x)`

`x[index]` 

- Abbreviations of states that ordered by murder total 

Index <- `order(murders$total)`

`murders$abb[index]`

- Find state with largest number of murders

i_max <- `which.max(murders$total)`

`murders$state[i_max]`
