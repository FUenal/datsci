### Welcome to *Data Science: Wrangling*!

We're excited to have you join us in this course, which is designed to teach you data wrangling, the process of converting raw data to the formats needed for further analysis.

This is the **sixth** in a series of courses in the Introduction to Data Science program, a series of courses that prepare you to do data analysis in `r rproj()`, from simple computations to machine learning. We assume that you have taken the preceding five courses in the series or have equivalent knowledge of R programming. We recommend that you complete the first five courses in the series (*Data Science: `r rproj()` Basics* (datsci_01), *Data Science: Visualization* (datsci_02), *Data Science: Probability* (datsci_03),  *Data Science: Inference and Modeling* (datsci_04), and *Data Science: Productivity Tools* (datsci_05)) before taking this course.

Using a combination of guided introduction through short video lectures and more independent in-depth exploration, you will get to practice your new `r rproj()` skills on real-life applications.

In this course, we cover several standard steps of the data wrangling process like importing data into `r rproj()`, tidying data, string processing, HTML parsing, working with dates and times, and text mining. Rarely are all these wrangling steps necessary in a single analysis, but a data scientist will likely face them all at some point. 

In a data science project, data are often not easily accessible. It's more likely for the data to be in a file, a database, or extracted from documents such as web pages, tweets, or PDFs. In these cases, the first step is to import the data into `r rproj()` and tidy the data, using the tidyverse package. The steps that convert data from its raw form to the tidy form are called data wrangling.

The class notes for this course series can be found in Professor Irizarry's freely available [Introduction to Data Science](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/). The textbook is also freely available in PDF format on [Leanpub](https://leanpub.com/datasciencebook). This course corresponds to textbook [Chapter 20](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/introduction-to-data-wrangling.html) through [Chapter 26](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/text-mining.html).

### In this course, you will learn:

- How to import data into  `r rproj()` from different file formats
- How to scrape data from the web
- How to tidy data using the tidyverse to better facilitate analysis
- How to process strings with regular expressions (regex)
- How to wrangle data using dplyr
- How to work with dates and times as file formats
- How to mine text

## Essential Course Information

### Course Syllabus

The course syllabus contains a more comprehensive version of the information below - but if you don't read the syllabus, please read this!

### Course Structure

This is a self-paced course. You can work on it with your own timeline in mind. However, we suggest that you work on a section per week, and it will take you 2 - 4 hours per week. 

Check the course home page for important dates. If you are interested in pursuing a Verified Certificate, you will need to upgrade before the date listed on the home page and finish all assignments before course close.

### Grading

Assignments in the course allow you to practice your coding skills using the DataCamp platform. R is a flexible programming language designed partly for readability and ease of programming.

HarvardX has partnered with a platform called DataCamp to create programming assignments that you can do online. There is no need to install anything on your computer. You will be given a set of code to modify and run in your browser. You can take as many attempts as you need. When your code works correctly, you will be awarded points. You can also request hints, which will help you out, but hints decrease your point total. Remember that you can always go to the Discussion Board for help that doesn't cost points.

### Passing Rate

The passing rate is 70%. You must sign up for a Verified Certificate and earn a grade of 70% of higher in order to obtain a certificate for this course.

## Section 1 Overview: Data Import

In the **Data Import** section, you will learn how import data into `r rproj()`.

After completing this section, you will be able to:

- **Import** data from spreadsheets.

- Identify and set your **working directory** and specify the **path** to a file.

- Use the **readr** and **readxl** packages to import spreadsheets.

- Use **R-base functions** to import spreadsheets.

- **Download** files from the internet using `r rproj()`.

There is a comprehension check at the end of the section.

We encourage you to use `r rproj()` to interactively test out your answers and further your own learning.

## Importing Spreadsheets


![](https://youtu.be/2hq5Qy124WE)


### Textbook link

The content is discussed within the [textbook section - 5 Importing data](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/importing-data.html).

### Key Points

- Many datasets are stored in spreadsheets. A spreadsheet is essentially a file version of a data frame with rows and columns.

- Spreadsheets have rows separated by returns and columns separated by a delimiter. The most common delimiters are comma, semicolon, white space and tab.

- Many spreadsheets are raw text files and can be read with any basic text editor. However, some formats are proprietary and cannot be read with a text editor, such as Microsoft Excel files (.xls).

- Most import functions assume that the first row of a spreadsheet file is a header with column names. To know if the file has a header, it helps to look at the file with a text editor before trying to import it.


## Paths and the Working Directory


![](https://youtu.be/0VjwKtnQTig)


### Textbook link

The content is discussed within the [textbook section - 5.1 Paths and the working directory](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/importing-data.html#paths-and-the-working-directory).

### Key Points

- The working directory is where `r rproj()` looks for files and saves files by default.

- See your working directory with `getwd()`. Change your working directory with `setwd()`.

- We suggest you create a directory for each project and keep your raw data inside that directory.

- Use the `file.path()` function to generate a full path from a relative path and a file name. Use `file.path()` instead of `paste()` because `file.path()` is aware of your operating system and will use the correct slashes to navigate your machine.

- The `file.copy()` function copies a file to a new path.

### Code

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# see working directory
getwd()

# change your working directory
setwd()

# set path to the location for raw data files in the dslabs package and list files
path <- system.file("extdata", package="dslabs")
list.files(path)

# generate a full path to a file
filename <- "murders.csv"
fullpath <- file.path(path, filename)
fullpath

# copy file from dslabs package to your working directory
file.copy(fullpath, getwd())

# check if the file exists
file.exists(filename)
```


## The readr and readxl Packages


![](https://youtu.be/MTljwff_-2A)


### Textbook link

The content is discussed within the [textbook section - 5.2 The readr and readxl packages](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/importing-data.html#the-readr-and-readxl-packages).

### Key Points

- **readr** is the **tidyverse** library that includes functions for reading data stored in text file spreadsheets into `r rproj()`. Functions in the package include `read_csv()`, `read_tsv()`, `read_delim()` and more. 

- These differ by the delimiter they use to split columns.

- The **readxl** package provides functions to read Microsoft Excel formatted files.

- The `excel_sheets()` function gives the names of the sheets in the Excel file. These names are passed to the sheet argument for the **readxl** functions `read_excel()`, `read_xls()` and `read_xlsx()`.

- The `read_lines()` function shows the first few lines of a file in `r rproj()`.

### Code

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(dslabs)
library(tidyverse)    # includes readr
library(readxl)

# inspect the first 3 lines
read_lines("murders.csv", n_max = 3)

# read file in CSV format
dat <- read_csv(filename)

#read using full path
dat <- read_csv(fullpath)
head(dat)

#Ex：
path <- system.file("extdata", package = "dslabs")
files <- list.files(path)
files

filename <- "murders.csv"
filename1 <- "life-expectancy-and-fertility-two-countries-example.csv"
filename2 <- "fertility-two-countries-example.csv"
dat=read.csv(file.path(path, filename))
dat1=read.csv(file.path(path, filename1))
dat2=read.csv(file.path(path, filename2))
```

## Importing Data Using R-base Functions


![](https://youtu.be/u5uS5PFAoAA)


### Textbook link

The content is discussed within the [textbook section - 5.5 R-base importing functions](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/importing-data.html#r-base-importing-functions). 

### Key Points

- R-base import functions (`read.csv()`, `read.table()`, `read.delim()`) generate data frames rather than tibbles and character variables are converted to factors. This can be avoided by setting the argument stringsAsFactors=FALSE.

### Code

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# filename is defined in the previous video
# read.csv converts strings to factors
dat2 <- read.csv(filename)
class(dat2$abb)
class(dat2$region)
```

## Downloading Files from the Internet


![](https://youtu.be/jVRHvPvmpys)


### Textbook link

The content is discussed within the [textbook section - 5.4 Downloading files](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/importing-data.html#downloading-files).


### Key Points

- The `read_csv()` function and other import functions can read a URL directly.

- If you want to have a local copy of the file, you can use `download.file()`.

- `tempdir()` creates a directory with a name that is very unlikely not to be unique.

- `tempfile()` creates a character string that is likely to be a unique filename.


### Code

```{r, eval = FALSE}
url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rafalab/dslabs/master/inst/extdata/murders.csv"
dat <- read_csv(url)
download.file(url, "murders.csv")
tempfile()
tmp_filename <- tempfile()
download.file(url, tmp_filename)
dat <- read_csv(tmp_filename)
file.remove(tmp_filename)
```

## Section 2 Overview: Tidy Data 

In the **Tidy Data** section, you will learn how to convert data from a raw to a tidy format.

This section is divided into three parts: **Reshaping Data, Combining Tables**, and **Web Scraping**. There are comprehension checks at the end of each part.

After completing the **Tidy Data** section, you will be able to:

- **Reshape data** using functions from the **tidyr** package, including `gather()`, `spread()`, `separate()` and `unite()`.

- Combine information from different tables using **join** functions from the **dplyr** package.

- Combine information from different tables using **binding** functions from the **dplyr** package.

- Use **set operators** to combine data frames.

- Gather data from a website through **web scraping** and use of **CSS selectors**.

We encourage you to use `r rproj()` to interactively test out your answers and further your own learning.

## Tidy Data


![](https://youtu.be/Wi_50VmBHaU)


### Textbook link

The content is discussed within the [textbook section - 4.1 Tidy data](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/tidyverse.html#tidy-data). 


### Key Points

- In tidy data, each row represents an observation and each column represents a different variable.

- In wide data, each row includes several observations and one of the variables is stored in the header.

### Code

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(dslabs)
data(gapminder)

# create and inspect a tidy data frame
tidy_data <- gapminder %>% 
  filter(country %in% c("South Korea", "Germany")) %>%
  select(country, year, fertility)
head(tidy_data)

# plotting tidy data is simple
tidy_data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(year, fertility, color = country)) +
  geom_point()

# import and inspect example of original Gapminder data in wide format
path <- system.file("extdata", package="dslabs")
filename <- file.path(path,  "fertility-two-countries-example.csv")
wide_data <- read_csv(filename)
select(wide_data, country, `1960`:`1967`)
```

## Reshaping Data


![](https://youtu.be/tnsORmsTfYY)


### Textbook link

The video correnponds to the [textbook section -  21. Reshaping data](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/reshaping-data.html), the [textbook section - 21.1 gather](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/reshaping-data.html#gather), and the [textbook section - 21.2 spread](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/reshaping-data.html#spread). 


### Key Points

- The **tidyr** package includes several functions that are useful for tidying data.

- The `gather()` function converts wide data into tidy data.

- The `spread()` function converts tidy data to wide data.

### Code

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# original wide data
library(tidyverse) 
path <- system.file("extdata", package="dslabs")
filename <- file.path(path,  "fertility-two-countries-example.csv")
wide_data <- read_csv(filename)

# tidy data from dslabs
library(dslabs)
data("gapminder")
tidy_data <- gapminder %>% 
  filter(country %in% c("South Korea", "Germany")) %>%
  select(country, year, fertility)

# gather wide data to make new tidy data
new_tidy_data <- wide_data %>%
  gather(year, fertility, `1960`:`2015`)
head(new_tidy_data)

# gather all columns except country
new_tidy_data <- wide_data %>%
  gather(year, fertility, -country)

# gather treats column names as characters by default
class(tidy_data$year)
class(new_tidy_data$year)

# convert gathered column names to numeric
new_tidy_data <- wide_data %>%
  gather(year, fertility, -country, convert = TRUE)
class(new_tidy_data$year)

# ggplot works on new tidy data
new_tidy_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(year, fertility, color = country)) +
  geom_point()

# spread tidy data to generate wide data
new_wide_data <- new_tidy_data %>% spread(year, fertility)
select(new_wide_data, country, `1960`:`1967`)
```

## Separate and Unite


![](https://youtu.be/jpMiktvJIcA)


### Textbook link

The video correnponds to the [textbook section -  21.3 separate](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/reshaping-data.html#separate), and the [textbook section - 21.4 unite](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/reshaping-data.html#unite). 


### Key Points

- The `separate()` function splits one column into two or more columns at a specified character that separates the variables.

- When there is an extra separation in some of the entries, use fill="right" to pad missing values with NAs, or use extra="merge" to keep extra elements together.

- The `unite()` function combines two columns and adds a separating character.

### Code

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# import data
path <- system.file("extdata", package = "dslabs")
filename <- file.path(path, "life-expectancy-and-fertility-two-countries-example.csv")
raw_dat <- read_csv(filename)
select(raw_dat, 1:5)

# gather all columns except country
dat <- raw_dat %>% gather(key, value, -country)
head(dat)
dat$key[1:5]

# separate on underscores
dat %>% separate(key, c("year", "variable_name"), "_")
dat %>% separate(key, c("year", "variable_name"))

# split on all underscores, pad empty cells with NA
dat %>% separate(key, c("year", "first_variable_name", "second_variable_name"), 
                 fill = "right")

# split on first underscore but keep life_expectancy merged
dat %>% separate(key, c("year", "variable_name"), sep = "_", extra = "merge")

# separate then spread
dat %>% separate(key, c("year", "variable_name"), sep = "_", extra = "merge") %>%
  spread(variable_name, value) 

# separate then unite
dat %>% 
  separate(key, c("year", "first_variable_name", "second_variable_name"), fill = "right") %>%
  unite(variable_name, first_variable_name, second_variable_name, sep="_")

# full code for tidying data
dat %>% 
  separate(key, c("year", "first_variable_name", "second_variable_name"), fill = "right") %>%
  unite(variable_name, first_variable_name, second_variable_name, sep="_") %>%
  spread(variable_name, value) %>%
  rename(fertility = fertility_NA)
```

## Combining Tables


![](https://youtu.be/a-KvIvsa01o)


### Textbook link

The video correnponds to the [textbook section -  22 Joining tables](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/joining-tables.html). 


### Key Points

- The join functions in the **dplyr** package combine two tables such that matching rows are together.

- `left_join()` only keeps rows that have information in the first table.

- `right_join()` only keeps rows that have information in the second table.

- `inner_join()` only keeps rows that have information in both tables.

- `full_join()` keeps all rows from both tables.

- `semi_join()` keeps the part of first table for which we have information in the second.

- `anti_join()` keeps the elements of the first table for which there is no information in the second.


### Code

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# import US murders data
library(tidyverse)
library(ggrepel)
library(dslabs)
ds_theme_set()
data(murders)
head(murders)

# import US election results data
data(polls_us_election_2016)
head(results_us_election_2016)
identical(results_us_election_2016$state, murders$state)

# join the murders table and US election results table
tab <- left_join(murders, results_us_election_2016, by = "state")
head(tab)

# plot electoral votes versus population
tab %>% ggplot(aes(population/10^6, electoral_votes, label = abb)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_text_repel() + 
  scale_x_continuous(trans = "log2") +
  scale_y_continuous(trans = "log2") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)

# make two smaller tables to demonstrate joins
tab1 <- slice(murders, 1:6) %>% select(state, population)
tab1
tab2 <- slice(results_us_election_2016, c(1:3, 5, 7:8)) %>% select(state, electoral_votes)
tab2

# experiment with different joins
left_join(tab1, tab2)
tab1 %>% left_join(tab2)
tab1 %>% right_join(tab2)
inner_join(tab1, tab2)
semi_join(tab1, tab2)
anti_join(tab1, tab2)
```

## Binding


![](https://youtu.be/TX-hnc94XD4)


### Textbook link

The video correnponds to the [textbook section -  22.2 Binding](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/joining-tables.html#binding). 


### Key Points

- Unlike the join functions, the binding functions do not try to match by a variable, but rather just combine datasets.

- `bind_cols()` binds two objects by making them columns in a tibble. The R-base function `cbind()` binds columns but makes a data frame or matrix instead.

- The `bind_rows()` function is similar but binds rows instead of columns. The R-base function `rbind()` binds rows but makes a data frame or matrix instead.

### Code

```{r, eval = FALSE}
bind_cols(a = 1:3, b = 4:6)

tab1 <- tab[, 1:3]
tab2 <- tab[, 4:6]
tab3 <- tab[, 7:9]
new_tab <- bind_cols(tab1, tab2, tab3)
head(new_tab)

tab1 <- tab[1:2,]
tab2 <- tab[3:4,]
bind_rows(tab1, tab2)
```

## Set Operators


![](https://youtu.be/xO4ClgupEGY)


### Textbook link

The video correnponds to the [textbook section -  22.3 Set operators](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/joining-tables.html#set-operators). 


### Key Points

- By default, the set operators in R-base work on vectors. If **tidyverse/dplyr** are loaded, they also work on data frames.

- You can take intersections of vectors using `intersect()`. This returns the elements common to both sets.

- You can take the union of vectors using `union()`. This returns the elements that are in either set.

- The set difference between a first and second argument can be obtained with `setdiff()`. Note that this function is not symmetric.

- The function `set_equal()` tells us if two sets are the same, regardless of the order of elements.

### Code

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# intersect vectors or data frames
intersect(1:10, 6:15)
intersect(c("a","b","c"), c("b","c","d"))
tab1 <- tab[1:5,]
tab2 <- tab[3:7,]
intersect(tab1, tab2)

# perform a union of vectors or data frames
union(1:10, 6:15)
union(c("a","b","c"), c("b","c","d"))
tab1 <- tab[1:5,]
tab2 <- tab[3:7,]
union(tab1, tab2)

# set difference of vectors or data frames
setdiff(1:10, 6:15)
setdiff(6:15, 1:10)
tab1 <- tab[1:5,]
tab2 <- tab[3:7,]
setdiff(tab1, tab2)

# setequal determines whether sets have the same elements, regardless of order
setequal(1:5, 1:6)
setequal(1:5, 5:1)
setequal(tab1, tab2)
```

## Web Scraping


![](https://youtu.be/0DXJtqqONJo)


### Textbook link

The video correnponds to the [textbook section - 23 Web scraping](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/web-scraping.html) through [textbook section - 23.2 The rvest package](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/web-scraping.html#the-rvest-package). 


### Key Points

- Web scraping is extracting data from a website.

- The **rvest** web harvesting package includes functions to extract nodes of an HTML document: `html_nodes() `extracts all nodes of different types, and `html_node()` extracts the first node.

- `html_table()` converts an HTML table to a data frame.

### Code

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# import a webpage into R
library(rvest)
url <- "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_in_the_United_States_by_state"
h <- read_html(url)
class(h)
h

tab <- h %>% html_nodes("table")
tab <- tab[[2]]

tab <- tab %>% html_table
class(tab)

tab <- tab %>% setNames(c("state", "population", "total", "murders", "gun_murders", "gun_ownership", "total_rate", "murder_rate", "gun_murder_rate"))
head(tab)
```

## CSS Selectors

This page correnponds to the [textbook section - 23.3 CSS selectors](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/web-scraping.html#css-selectors)

The default look of webpages made with the most basic HTML is quite unattractive. The aesthetically pleasing pages we see today are made using CSS. CSS is used to add style to webpages. The fact that all pages for a company have the same style is usually a result that they all use the same CSS file. The general way these CSS files work is by defining how each of the elements of a webpage will look. The title, headings, itemized lists, tables, and links, for example, each receive their own style including font, color, size, and distance from the margin, among others.

To do this CSS leverages patterns used to define these elements, referred to as selectors. An example of pattern we used in a previous video is table but there are many many more. If we want to grab data from a webpage and we happen to know a selector that is unique to the part of the page, we can use the `html_nodes()` function.

However, knowing which selector to use can be quite complicated. To demonstrate this we will try to extract the recipe name, total preparation time, and list of ingredients from [this guacamole recipe](https://foodnetwork.co.uk/recipes/guacamole/?utm_source=foodnetwork.com&utm_medium=domestic). Looking at the code for this page, it seems that the task is impossibly complex. However, selector gadgets actually make this possible. [SelectorGadget](https://selectorgadget.com/) is piece of software that allows you to interactively determine what CSS selector you need to extract specific components from the webpage. If you plan on scraping data other than tables, we highly recommend you install it. A Chrome extension is available which permits you to turn on the gadget highlighting parts of the page as you click through, showing the necessary selector to extract those segments.

For the guacamole recipe page, we already have done this and determined that we need the following selectors:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
h <- read_html("http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/guacamole-recipe-1940609")
recipe <- h %>% html_node(".o-AssetTitle__a-HeadlineText") %>% html_text()
prep_time <- h %>% html_node(".m-RecipeInfo__a-Description--Total") %>% html_text()
ingredients <- h %>% html_nodes(".o-Ingredients__a-Ingredient") %>% html_text()
```

You can see how complex the selectors are. In any case we are now ready to extract what we want and create a list:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
guacamole <- list(recipe, prep_time, ingredients)
guacamole
```

Since recipe pages from this website follow this general layout, we can use this code to create a function that extracts this information:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
get_recipe <- function(url){
    h <- read_html(url)
    recipe <- h %>% html_node(".o-AssetTitle__a-HeadlineText") %>% html_text()
    prep_time <- h %>% html_node(".m-RecipeInfo__a-Description--Total") %>% html_text()
    ingredients <- h %>% html_nodes(".o-Ingredients__a-Ingredient") %>% html_text()
    return(list(recipe = recipe, prep_time = prep_time, ingredients = ingredients))
} 
```

and then use it on any of their webpages:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
get_recipe("http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/food-network-kitchen/pancakes-recipe-1913844")
```

There are several other powerful tools provided by **rvest**. For example, the functions `html_form()`, `set_values()`, and `submit_form()` permit you to query a webpage from `r rproj()`. This is a more advanced topic not covered here.

## 2.3 Assessment: Web Scraping

Insert Assessment here

## Section 3 Overview: String Processing

In the **String Processing** section, we use case studies that help demonstrate how string processing is a powerful tool useful for overcoming many data wrangling challenges. You will see how the original **raw** data was processed to create the data frames we have used in courses throughout this series.

This section is divided into three parts. There are comprehension checks at the end of each of the three parts.

After completing the **String Processing** section, you will be able to:

- **Remove** unwanted characters from text.
- **Extract  numeric** values from text.
- **Find** and **replace** characters.
- **Extract  specific** parts of strings.
- **Convert** free form text into more uniform formats.
- **Split strings** into multiple values.
- Use **regular expressions (regex)** to process strings.

We encourage you to use `r rproj()` to interactively test out your answers and further your own learning.

## String Parsing


![](https://youtu.be/qmme0ELJSE4)


### Textbook link

The video correnponds to the [textbook section - 24 String processing](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/string-processing.html). 


### Key Points

- The most common tasks in string processing include:

  - extracting numbers from strings
  
  - removing unwanted characters from text
  
  - finding and replacing characters
  
  - extracting specific parts of strings
  
  - converting free form text to more uniform formats
  
  - splitting strings into multiple values

- The **stringr** package in the **tidyverse** contains string processing functions that follow a similar naming format (str_functionname) and are compatible with the pipe.


## Defining Strings: Single and Double Quotes and How to Escape


![](https://youtu.be/0Jcp0LL5nL0)


### Textbook link

The video correnponds to the [textbook section - 24.4 How to escape when defining strings](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/string-processing.html#how-to-escape-when-defining-strings). 

### Key Points

- Define a string by surrounding text with either single quotes or double quotes.

- To include a single quote inside a string, use double quotes on the outside. To include a double quote inside a string, use single quotes on the outside.

- The `cat()` function displays a string as it is represented inside `r rproj()`.

- To include a double quote inside of a string surrounded by double quotes, use the backslash (\) to escape the double quote. Escape a single quote to include it inside of a string defined by single quotes.

- We will see additional uses of the escape later.


### Code

```{r, eval = FALSE}
s <- "Hello!"    # double quotes define a string
s <- 'Hello!'    # single quotes define a string
s <- `Hello`    # backquotes do not

s <- "10""    # error - unclosed quotes
s <- '10"'    # correct

# cat shows what the string actually looks like inside R
cat(s)

s <- "5'"
cat(s)

# to include both single and double quotes in string, escape with \
s <- '5'10"'    # error
s <- "5'10""    # error
s <- '5\'10"'    # correct
cat(s)
s <- "5'10\""    # correct
cat(s)
```


## stringr Package


![](https://youtu.be/WgoXp1rP8Nk)


### Textbook link

The content is discussed within the [textbook section - 24.1 The stringr package](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/string-processing.html#stringr). 


### Key Points

- The main types of string processing tasks are detecting, locating, extracting and replacing elements of strings.

- The **stringr** package from the **tidyverse** includes a variety of string processing functions that begin with str_ and take the string as the first argument, which makes them compatible with the pipe.


### Code

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# murders_raw defined in web scraping video

# direct conversion to numeric fails because of commas
murders_raw$population[1:3]
as.numeric(murders_raw$population[1:3])

library(tidyverse)    # includes stringr
```

## Case Study 1: US Murders Data


![](https://youtu.be/GXAU9i7CnfM)


### Note

The Wikipedia page with US murder data has been updated since this video was created and is no longer easily converted with `as.numeric()` due to inclusion of endnote links. We will learn more string processing methods later that can be used to remove these endnotes. 
### Textbook link

The content is discussed within the [textbook section - 24.2 Case study 1: US murders data](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/string-processing.html#case-study-1-us-murders-data). 

### Key Points

- Use the `str_detect()` function to determine whether a string contains a certain pattern.

- Use the `str_replace_all()` function to replace all instances of one pattern with another pattern. To remove a pattern, replace with the empty string (" ").

- The `parse_number()` function removes punctuation from strings and converts them to numeric.

- `mutate_at()` performs the same transformation on the specified column numbers.

### Code

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# murders_raw was defined in the web scraping section

# detect whether there are commas
commas <- function(x) any(str_detect(x, ","))
murders_raw %>% summarize_all(funs(commas))

# replace commas with the empty string and convert to numeric
test_1 <- str_replace_all(murders_raw$population, ",", "")
test_1 <- as.numeric(test_1)

# parse_number also removes commas and converts to numeric
test_2 <- parse_number(murders_raw$population)
identical(test_1, test_2)

murders_new <- murders_raw %>% mutate_at(2:3, parse_number)
murders_new %>% head
```

## Case Study 2: Reported Heights


![](https://youtu.be/R6d-H3JANrk)


### Textbook link

The content is discussed within the [textbook section - 24.3 Case study 2: self-reported heights](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/string-processing.html#case-study-2-self-reported-heights). 


### Key Points

- In the raw heights data, many students did not report their height as the number of inches as requested. There are many entries with real height information but in the wrong format, which we can extract with string processing. 

- When there are both text and numeric entries in a column, the column will be a character vector. Converting this column to numeric will result in NAs for some entries.

- To correct problematic entries, look for patterns that are shared across large numbers of entries, then define rules that identify those patterns and use these rules to write string processing tasks.

- Use `suppressWarnings()` to hide warning messages for a function.

### Code

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# load raw heights data and inspect
library(dslabs)
data(reported_heights)
class(reported_heights$height)

# convert to numeric, inspect, count NAs
x <- as.numeric(reported_heights$height)
head(x)
sum(is.na(x))

# keep only entries that result in NAs
reported_heights %>% mutate(new_height = as.numeric(height)) %>%
  filter(is.na(new_height)) %>% 
  head(n=10)

# calculate cutoffs that cover 99.999% of human population
alpha <- 1/10^6
qnorm(1-alpha/2, 69.1, 2.9)
qnorm(alpha/2, 63.7, 2.7)

# keep only entries that either result in NAs or are outside the plausible range of heights
not_inches <- function(x, smallest = 50, tallest = 84){
  inches <- suppressWarnings(as.numeric(x))
  ind <- is.na(inches) | inches < smallest | inches > tallest
  ind
}

# number of problematic entries
problems <- reported_heights %>% 
  filter(not_inches(height)) %>%
  .$height
length(problems)

# 10 examples of x'y or x'y" or x'y\"
pattern <- "^\\d\\s*'\\s*\\d{1,2}\\.*\\d*'*\"*$"
str_subset(problems, pattern) %>% head(n=10) %>% cat

# 10 examples of x.y or x,y
pattern <- "^[4-6]\\s*[\\.|,]\\s*([0-9]|10|11)$"
str_subset(problems, pattern) %>% head(n=10) %>% cat

# 10 examples of entries in cm rather than inches
ind <- which(between(suppressWarnings(as.numeric(problems))/2.54, 54, 81) )
ind <- ind[!is.na(ind)]
problems[ind] %>% head(n=10) %>% cat
```

## Regex


![](https://youtu.be/3cdpz1FtSMs)


### Textbook link

This video corresponds to the [textbook section - 24.5 Regular expressions](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/string-processing.html#regular-expressions) through [textbook section - 24.5.2 Special characters](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/string-processing.html#special-characters). 


### Key Points

- A regular expression (regex) is a way to describe a specific pattern of characters of text. A set of rules has been designed to do this specifically and efficiently.

- **stringr** functions can take a regex as a pattern.

- `str_detect()` indicates whether a pattern is present in a string.

- The main difference between a regex and a regular string is that a regex can include special characters.

- The | symbol inside a regex means "or".

- Use '\\d' to represent digits. The backlash is used to distinguish it from the character 'd'. In R, you must use two backslashes for digits in regular expressions; in some other languages, you will only use one backslash for regex special characters.

- `str_view()` highlights the first occurrence of a pattern, and the `str_view_all()` function highlights all occurrences of the pattern.


### Code

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# load stringr through tidyverse
library(tidyverse)

# detect whether a comma is present
pattern <- ","
str_detect(murders_raw$total, pattern) 

# show the subset of strings including "cm"
str_subset(reported_heights$height, "cm")

# use the "or" symbol inside a regex (|)
yes <- c("180 cm", "70 inches")
no <- c("180", "70''")
s <- c(yes, no)
str_detect(s, "cm") | str_detect(s, "inches")
str_detect(s, "cm|inches")

# highlight the first occurrence of a pattern
str_view(s, pattern)

# highlight all instances of a pattern
str_view_all(s, pattern)
```

## Character Classes, Anchors and Quantifiers


![](https://youtu.be/PhkPF7jRPH0)


### Textbook link

This video corresponds to the [textbook section - 24.5.3 Character classes](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/string-processing.html#character-classes), and [textbook section - 24.5.4 Anchors](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/string-processing.html#anchors), and [textbook section - 24.5.5 Quantifiers](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/string-processing.html#quantifiers). 


### Key Points

- Define strings to test your regular expressions, including some elements that match and some that do not. This allows you to check for the two types of errors: failing to match and matching incorrectly.

- Square brackets define character classes: groups of characters that count as matching the pattern. You can use ranges to define character classes, such as [0-9] for digits and [a-zA-Z] for all letters.

- Anchors define patterns that must start or end at specific places. ^ and $ represent the beginning and end of the string respectively.

- Curly braces are quantifiers that state how many times a certain character can be repeated in the pattern. \\d{1,2} matches exactly 1 or 2 consecutive digits.


### Code

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# s was defined in the previous video
yes <- c("5", "6", "5'10", "5 feet", "4'11")
no <- c("", ".", "Five", "six")
s <- c(yes, no)
pattern <- "\\d"

# [56] means 5 or 6
str_view(s, "[56]")

# [4-7] means 4, 5, 6 or 7
yes <- as.character(4:7)
no <- as.character(1:3)
s <- c(yes, no)
str_detect(s, "[4-7]")

# ^ means start of string, $ means end of string
pattern <- "^\\d$"
yes <- c("1", "5", "9")
no <- c("12", "123", " 1", "a4", "b")
s <- c(yes, no)
str_view(s, pattern)

# curly braces define quantifiers: 1 or 2 digits 
pattern <- "^\\d{1,2}$"
yes <- c("1", "5", "9", "12")
no <- c("123", "a4", "b")
str_view(c(yes, no), pattern)

# combining character class, anchors and quantifier
pattern <- "^[4-7]'\\d{1,2}\"$"
yes <- c("5'7\"", "6'2\"",  "5'12\"")
no <- c("6,2\"", "6.2\"","I am 5'11\"", "3'2\"", "64")
str_detect(yes, pattern)
str_detect(no, pattern)
```

## Search and Replace with Regex


![](https://youtu.be/zBd8QBge3jM)


### Textbook link

This video corresponds to the following textbook sections:

- [textbook section - 24.6 Search and replace with regex](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/string-processing.html#search-and-replace-with-regex),  

- [textbook section - 24.5.6 White space \s](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/string-processing.html#white-space-s)

- [textbook section - 24.5.7 Quantifiers: *, ?, +](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/string-processing.html#quantifiers-1). 


### Key Points

- `str_replace()` replaces the first instance of the detected pattern with a specified string.

- Spaces are characters and R does not ignore them. Spaces are specified by the special character \\s.

- Additional quantifiers include *, + and ?. * means 0 or more instances of the previous character. ? means 0 or 1 instances. + means 1 or more instances.

- Before removing characters from strings with functions like `str_replace()` and `str_replace_all()`, consider whether that replacement would have unintended effects.


### Code
The problems object is defined in the [reported heights case study introduction video](https://youtu.be/R6d-H3JANrk).

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# number of entries matching our desired pattern
pattern <- "^[4-7]'\\d{1,2}\"$"
sum(str_detect(problems, pattern))

# inspect examples of entries with problems
problems[c(2, 10, 11, 12, 15)] %>% str_view(pattern)
str_subset(problems, "inches")
str_subset(problems, "''")

# replace or remove feet/inches words before matching
pattern <- "^[4-7]'\\d{1,2}$"
problems %>% 
  str_replace("feet|ft|foot", "'") %>% # replace feet, ft, foot with ' 
  str_replace("inches|in|''|\"", "") %>% # remove all inches symbols
  str_detect(pattern) %>% 
  sum()

# R does not ignore whitespace
identical("Hi", "Hi ")

# \\s represents whitespace
pattern_2 <- "^[4-7]'\\s\\d{1,2}\"$"
str_subset(problems, pattern_2)

# * means 0 or more instances of a character
yes <- c("AB", "A1B", "A11B", "A111B", "A1111B")
no <- c("A2B", "A21B")
str_detect(yes, "A1*B")
str_detect(no, "A1*B")

# test how *, ? and + differ
data.frame(string = c("AB", "A1B", "A11B", "A111B", "A1111B"),
           none_or_more = str_detect(yes, "A1*B"),
           nore_or_once = str_detect(yes, "A1?B"),
           once_or_more = str_detect(yes, "A1+B"))
           
# update pattern by adding optional spaces before and after feet symbol
pattern <- "^[4-7]\\s*'\\s*\\d{1,2}$"
problems %>% 
  str_replace("feet|ft|foot", "'") %>% # replace feet, ft, foot with ' 
  str_replace("inches|in|''|\"", "") %>% # remove all inches symbols
  str_detect(pattern) %>% 
  sum()
```

## Groups with Regex


![](https://youtu.be/Am5LAxpcbX8)


### Correction

At 3:17, the video states that the code shown will replace certain commas with a period. The code actually replaces those commas with a single quote, '.


### Textbook link

This video corresponds to the [textbook section - 24.5.9 Groups](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/string-processing.html#groups)


### Key Points

- Groups are defined using parentheses.

- Once we define groups, we can use the function `str_match()` to extract the values these groups define. `str_extract()` extracts only strings that match a pattern, not the values defined by groups.

- You can refer to the ith group with \\i. For example, refer to the value in the second group with \\2.


### Code

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# define regex with and without groups
pattern_without_groups <- "^[4-7],\\d*$"
pattern_with_groups <-  "^([4-7]),(\\d*)$"

# create examples
yes <- c("5,9", "5,11", "6,", "6,1")
no <- c("5'9", ",", "2,8", "6.1.1")
s <- c(yes, no)

# demonstrate the effect of groups
str_detect(s, pattern_without_groups)
str_detect(s, pattern_with_groups)

# demonstrate difference between str_match and str_extract
str_match(s, pattern_with_groups)
str_extract(s, pattern_with_groups)

# improve the pattern to recognize more events
pattern_with_groups <-  "^([4-7]),(\\d*)$"
yes <- c("5,9", "5,11", "6,", "6,1")
no <- c("5'9", ",", "2,8", "6.1.1")
s <- c(yes, no)
str_replace(s, pattern_with_groups, "\\1'\\2")

# final pattern
pattern_with_groups <-"^([4-7])\\s*[,\\.\\s+]\\s*(\\d*)$"

# combine stringr commands with the pipe
str_subset(problems, pattern_with_groups) %>% head
str_subset(problems, pattern_with_groups) %>% 
  str_replace(pattern_with_groups, "\\1'\\2") %>% head
```

## Testing and Improving


![](https://youtu.be/w-jS3N_EgpI)


### Textbook link

This video corresponds to the [textbook section - 24.7 Testing and improving](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/string-processing.html#testing-and-improving)


### Key Points

- Wrangling with regular expressions is often an iterative process of testing the approach, looking for problematic entries, and improving the patterns.

- Use the pipe to connect **stringr** functions.

- It may not be worth writing code to correct every unique problem in the data, but string processing techniques are flexible enough for most needs.


### Code

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# function to detect entries with problems
not_inches_or_cm <- function(x, smallest = 50, tallest = 84){
    inches <- suppressWarnings(as.numeric(x))
    ind <- !is.na(inches) &
        ((inches >= smallest & inches <= tallest) |
             (inches/2.54 >= smallest & inches/2.54 <= tallest))
    !ind
}

# identify entries with problems
problems <- reported_heights %>% 
  filter(not_inches_or_cm(height)) %>%
  .$height
length(problems)

converted <- problems %>% 
  str_replace("feet|foot|ft", "'") %>% #convert feet symbols to '
  str_replace("inches|in|''|\"", "") %>%  #remove inches symbols
  str_replace("^([4-7])\\s*[,\\.\\s+]\\s*(\\d*)$", "\\1'\\2") ##change format

# find proportion of entries that fit the pattern after reformatting
pattern <- "^[4-7]\\s*'\\s*\\d{1,2}$"
index <- str_detect(converted, pattern)
mean(index)

converted[!index]    # show problems
```

## 3.3 Separate with Regex


![](https://youtu.be/5N0S2KXichE)


### Textbook link

This video corresponds to the [textbook section - 24.10.1 The extract function](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/string-processing.html#the-extract-function)


### Key Points

- The `extract()` function behaves similarly to the `separate()` function but allows extraction of groups from regular expressions.


### Code

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# first example - normally formatted heights
s <- c("5'10", "6'1")
tab <- data.frame(x = s)

# the separate and extract functions behave similarly
tab %>% separate(x, c("feet", "inches"), sep = "'")
tab %>% extract(x, c("feet", "inches"), regex = "(\\d)'(\\d{1,2})")

# second example - some heights with unusual formats
s <- c("5'10", "6'1\"","5'8inches")
tab <- data.frame(x = s)

# separate fails because it leaves in extra characters, but extract keeps only the digits because of regex groups
tab %>% separate(x, c("feet","inches"), sep = "'", fill = "right")
tab %>% extract(x, c("feet", "inches"), regex = "(\\d)'(\\d{1,2})")
```

## Using Groups and Quantifiers

This page corresponds to material in  [textbook sections - 24.7 through 24.10 ](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/string-processing.html#testing-and-improving)

Four clear patterns of entries have arisen along with some other minor problems:

- Many students measuring exactly 5 or 6 feet did not enter any inches. For example, **6'** - our pattern requires that inches be included.

- Some students measuring exactly 5 or 6 feet entered just that number.

- Some of the inches were entered with decimal points. For example **5'7.5''**. Our pattern only looks for two digits.

- Some entires have spaces at the end, for example **5 ' 9**.

- Some entries are in meters and some of these use European decimals: **1.6, 1,7**.

- Two students added **cm**.

- One student spelled out the numbers: **Five foot eight inches**.

It is not necessarily clear that it is worth writing code to handle all these cases since they might be rare enough. However, some give us an opportunity to learn some more regex techniques so we will build a fix.

### Case 1
For case 1, if we add a '0 to, for example, convert all 6 to 6'0, then our pattern will match. This can be done using groups using the following code:


```{r, eval = FALSE}
yes <- c("5", "6", "5")
no <- c("5'", "5''", "5'4")
s <- c(yes, no)
str_replace(s, "^([4-7])$", "\\1'0")
```

The pattern says it has to start (^), be followed with a digit between 4 and 7, and then end there (**$**). The parenthesis defines the group that we pass as **\\1** to the replace regex.

### Cases 2 and 4
We can adapt this code slightly to handle case 2 as well which covers the entry **5'**. Note that the **5'** is left untouched by the code above. This is because the extra ' makes the pattern not match since we have to end with a 5 or 6. To handle case 2, we want to permit the 5 or 6 to be followed by no or one symbol for feet. So we can simply add '**{0,1}** after the ' to do this. We can also use the none or once special character ?. As we saw previously, this is different from * which is none or more. We now see that this code also handles the fourth case as well:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
str_replace(s, "^([56])'?$", "\\1'0")
```

Note that here we only permit 5 and 6 but not 4 and 7. This is because heights of exactly 5 and exactly 6 feet tall are quite common, so we assume those that typed 5 or 6 really meant either 60 or 72 inches. However, heights of exactly 4 or exactly 7 feet tall are so rare that, although we accept 84 as a valid entry, we assume that a 7 was entered in error.

### Case 3
We can use quantifiers to deal with  case 3. These entries are not matched because the inches include decimals and our pattern does not permit this. We need allow the second group to include decimals and not just digits. This means we must permit zero or one period . followed by zero or more digits. So we will use both **?** and *. Also remember that for this particular case, the period needs to be escaped since it is a special character (it means any character except a line break).

So we can adapt our pattern, currently **^[4-7]\\s*'\\s*\\d{1,2}$**, to permit a decimal at the end:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
pattern <- "^[4-7]\\s*'\\s*(\\d+\\.?\\d*)$"
```

### Case 5 
Case 5, meters using commas, we can approach similarly to how we converted the x.y to x'y. A difference is that we require that the first digit is 1 or 2:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
yes <- c("1,7", "1, 8", "2, " )
no <- c("5,8", "5,3,2", "1.7")
s <- c(yes, no)
str_replace(s, "^([12])\\s*,\\s*(\\d*)$", "\\1\\.\\2")
```

We will later check if the entries are meters using their numeric values.

### Trimming 
In general, spaces at the start or end of the string are uninformative. These can be particularly deceptive because sometimes they can be hard to see:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
s <- "Hi "
cat(s)
identical(s, "Hi")
```

This is a general enough problem that there is a function dedicated to removing them: `str_trim`.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
str_trim("5 ' 9 ")
```

### To upper and to lower case 
One of the entries writes out numbers as words: **Five foot eight inches**. Although not efficient, we could add 12 extra **str_replace** to convert **zero** to **0**, one to **1**, and so on. To avoid having to write two separate operations for **Zero** and **zero**, **One** and **one**, etc., we can use the `str_to_lower()` function to make all words lower case first:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
s <- c("Five feet eight inches")
str_to_lower(s)
```

### Putting it into a function 
We are now ready to define a procedure that handles converting all the problematic cases.

We can now put all this together into a function that takes a string vector and tries to convert as many strings as possible to a single format. Below is a function that puts together the previous code replacements:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
convert_format <- function(s){
  s %>%
    str_replace("feet|foot|ft", "'") %>% #convert feet symbols to '
    str_replace_all("inches|in|''|\"|cm|and", "") %>%  #remove inches and other symbols
    str_replace("^([4-7])\\s*[,\\.\\s+]\\s*(\\d*)$", "\\1'\\2") %>% #change x.y, x,y x y
    str_replace("^([56])'?$", "\\1'0") %>% #add 0 when to 5 or 6
    str_replace("^([12])\\s*,\\s*(\\d*)$", "\\1\\.\\2") %>% #change european decimal
    str_trim() #remove extra space
}
```

We can also write a function that converts words to numbers:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
words_to_numbers <- function(s){
  str_to_lower(s) %>%  
    str_replace_all("zero", "0") %>%
    str_replace_all("one", "1") %>%
    str_replace_all("two", "2") %>%
    str_replace_all("three", "3") %>%
    str_replace_all("four", "4") %>%
    str_replace_all("five", "5") %>%
    str_replace_all("six", "6") %>%
    str_replace_all("seven", "7") %>%
    str_replace_all("eight", "8") %>%
    str_replace_all("nine", "9") %>%
    str_replace_all("ten", "10") %>%
    str_replace_all("eleven", "11")
}
```

Now we can see which problematic entries remain:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
converted <- problems %>% words_to_numbers %>% convert_format
remaining_problems <- converted[not_inches_or_cm(converted)]
pattern <- "^[4-7]\\s*'\\s*\\d+\\.?\\d*$"
index <- str_detect(remaining_problems, pattern)
remaining_problems[!index]
```

## Putting it All Together

We are now ready to put everything we've done so far together and wrangle our reported heights data as we try to recover as many heights as possible. The code is complex but we will break it down into parts.

We start by cleaning up the height column so that the heights are closer to a feet'inches format. We added an original heights column so we can compare before and after.

Let's start by writing a function that cleans up strings so that all the feet and inches formats use the same x'y format when appropriate.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
pattern <- "^([4-7])\\s*'\\s*(\\d+\\.?\\d*)$"

smallest <- 50
tallest <- 84
new_heights <- reported_heights %>% 
  mutate(original = height, 
         height = words_to_numbers(height) %>% convert_format()) %>%
  extract(height, c("feet", "inches"), regex = pattern, remove = FALSE) %>% 
  mutate_at(c("height", "feet", "inches"), as.numeric) %>%
  mutate(guess = 12*feet + inches) %>%
  mutate(height = case_when(
    !is.na(height) & between(height, smallest, tallest) ~ height, #inches 
    !is.na(height) & between(height/2.54, smallest, tallest) ~ height/2.54, #centimeters
    !is.na(height) & between(height*100/2.54, smallest, tallest) ~ height*100/2.54, #meters
    !is.na(guess) & inches < 12 & between(guess, smallest, tallest) ~ guess, #feet'inches
    TRUE ~ as.numeric(NA))) %>%
  select(-guess)
```

We can check all the entries we converted using the following code:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
new_heights %>%
  filter(not_inches(original)) %>%
  select(original, height) %>% 
  arrange(height) %>%
  View()
```

Let's take a look at the shortest students in our dataset using the following code:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
new_heights %>% arrange(height) %>% head(n=7)
```

We see heights of 53, 54, and 55. In the original heights column, we also have 51 and 52. These short heights are very rare and it is likely that the students actually meant 5'1, 5'2, 5'3, 5'4, and 5'5. But because we are not completely sure, we will leave them as reported.

## String Splitting


![](https://youtu.be/XqlfSzj1QXM)


### Textbook link

This video corresponds to the [textbook section - 24.11 String splitting](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/string-processing.html#string-splitting)


### Key Points

- The function `str_split()` splits a string into a character vector on a delimiter (such as a comma, space or underscore). By default, `str_split()` generates a list with one element for each original string. Use the function argument `simplify=TRUE` to have `str_split()` return a matrix instead.

- The `map()` function from the **purrr** package applies the same function to each element of a list. To extract the ith entry of each element x, use map(x, i).

- `map()` always returns a list. Use `map_chr()` to return a character vector and `map_int()` to return an integer.


### Code

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# read raw murders data line by line
filename <- system.file("extdata/murders.csv", package = "dslabs")
lines <- readLines(filename)
lines %>% head()

# split at commas with str_split function, remove row of column names
x <- str_split(lines, ",") 
x %>% head()
col_names <- x[[1]]
x <- x[-1]

# extract first element of each list entry
library(purrr)
map(x, function(y) y[1]) %>% head()
map(x, 1) %>% head()

# extract columns 1-5 as characters, then convert to proper format - NOTE: DIFFERENT FROM VIDEO
dat <- data.frame(parse_guess(map_chr(x, 1)),
                  parse_guess(map_chr(x, 2)),
                  parse_guess(map_chr(x, 3)),
                  parse_guess(map_chr(x, 4)),
                  parse_guess(map_chr(x, 5))) %>%
  setNames(col_names)
  
dat %>% head
  
# more efficient code for the same thing
dat <- x %>%
  transpose() %>%
  map( ~ parse_guess(unlist(.))) %>%
  setNames(col_names) %>% 
  as.data.frame() 

# the simplify argument makes str_split return a matrix instead of a list
x <- str_split(lines, ",", simplify = TRUE) 
col_names <- x[1,]
x <- x[-1,]
x %>% as_data_frame() %>%
  setNames(col_names) %>%
  mutate_all(parse_guess)
```

## Case Study: Extracting a Table from a PDF

This page corresponds to the [textbook section - 24.12 Case study 3: extracting tables from a PDF](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/string-processing.html#case-study-3-extracting-tables-from-a-pdf)

One of the datasets provided in dslabs shows scientific funding rates by gender in the Netherlands:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(dslabs)
data("research_funding_rates")
research_funding_rates 
```

The data come from a [paper](https://www.pnas.org/content/112/40/12349.abstract) published in the prestigious journal PNAS. However, the data are not provided in a spreadsheet; they are in a table in a PDF document. We could extract the numbers by hand, but this could lead to human error. Instead we can try to wrangle the data using R.

### Downloading the data

We start by downloading the PDF document then importing it into R using the following code:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library("pdftools")
temp_file <- tempfile()
url <- "http://www.pnas.org/content/suppl/2015/09/16/1510159112.DCSupplemental/pnas.201510159SI.pdf"
download.file(url, temp_file)
txt <- pdf_text(temp_file)
file.remove(temp_file)
```

If we examine the object text we notice that it is a character vector with an entry for each page. So we keep the page we want using the following code:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
raw_data_research_funding_rates <- txt[2]
```

The steps above can actually be skipped because we include the raw data in the dslabs package as well:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
data("raw_data_research_funding_rates")
```

## Looking at the download
Examining this object,

```{r, eval = FALSE}
raw_data_research_funding_rates %>% head
```

we see that it is a long string. Each line on the page, including the table rows, is separated by the symbol for newline: \n.

We can therefore can create a list with the lines of the text as elements:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
tab <- str_split(raw_data_research_funding_rates, "\n")
```

Because we start off with just one element in the string, we end up with a list with just one entry:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
tab <- tab[[1]]
```

By examining this object,

```{r, eval = FALSE}
tab %>% head
```

we see that the information for the column names is the third and fourth entires:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
the_names_1 <- tab[3]
the_names_2 <- tab[4]
```

In the table, the column information is spread across two lines. We want to create one vector with one name for each column. We can do this using some of the functions we have just learned.

## Extracting the table data
Let's start with the first line:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
the_names_1
```

We want to remove the leading space and everything following the comma. We can use regex for the latter. Then we can obtain the elements by splitting using the space. We want to split only when there are 2 or more spaces to avoid splitting success rate. So we use the regex \\s{2,} as follows:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
the_names_1 <- the_names_1 %>%
  str_trim() %>%
  str_replace_all(",\\s.", "") %>%
  str_split("\\s{2,}", simplify = TRUE)
the_names_1
```

Now let's look at the second line:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
the_names_2
```

Here we want to trim the leading space and then split by space as we did for the first line:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
the_names_2 <- the_names_2 %>%
  str_trim() %>%
  str_split("\\s+", simplify = TRUE)
the_names_2
```

Now we can join these to generate one name for each column:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
tmp_names <- str_c(rep(the_names_1, each = 3), the_names_2[-1], sep = "_")
the_names <- c(the_names_2[1], tmp_names) %>%
  str_to_lower() %>%
  str_replace_all("\\s", "_")
the_names
```

Now we are ready to get the actual data. By examining the tab object, we notice that the information is in lines 6 through 14. We can use `str_split()` again to achieve our goal:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
new_research_funding_rates <- tab[6:14] %>%
  str_trim %>%
  str_split("\\s{2,}", simplify = TRUE) %>%
  data.frame(stringsAsFactors = FALSE) %>%
  setNames(the_names) %>%
  mutate_at(-1, parse_number)
new_research_funding_rates %>% head()
```

We can see that the objects are identical:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
identical(research_funding_rates, new_research_funding_rates)
```

## Recoding


![](https://youtu.be/0sPR4CMC6Xw)


### Textbook link

This video corresponds to the [textbook section - 24.13 Recoding](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/string-processing.html#recode)


### Key Points

- Change long factor names with the `recode()` function from the **tidyverse**. 

- Other similar functions include `recode_factor()` and `fct_recoder()` in the **forcats** package in the **tidyverse**. The same result could be obtained using the `case_when()` function, but `recode()` is more efficient to write.


### Code

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# life expectancy time series for Caribbean countries
library(dslabs)
data("gapminder")
gapminder %>% 
  filter(region=="Caribbean") %>%
  ggplot(aes(year, life_expectancy, color = country)) +
  geom_line()

# display long country names
gapminder %>% 
  filter(region=="Caribbean") %>%
  filter(str_length(country) >= 12) %>%
  distinct(country) 

# recode long country names and remake plot
gapminder %>% filter(region=="Caribbean") %>%
  mutate(country = recode(country, 
                          'Antigua and Barbuda'="Barbuda",
                          'Dominican Republic' = "DR",
                          'St. Vincent and the Grenadines' = "St. Vincent",
                          'Trinidad and Tobago' = "Trinidad")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(year, life_expectancy, color = country)) +
  geom_line()
```

## Section 4 Overview: Dates, Times, and Text Mining Overview

In the **Dates, Times, and Text Mining** section, you will learn how to deal with dates and times in `r rproj()` and also how to generate numerical summaries from text data.

After completing this section, you will be able to:

- Handle **dates** and **times** in `r rproj()`.

- Use the **lubridate** package to parse dates and times in different formats.

- Generate **numerical summaries from text data** and apply data visualization and analysis techniques to those data.

There is a comprehension check at the end of the section.

We encourage you to use `r rproj()` to interactively test out your answers and further your own learning.

## Dates and Times


![](https://youtu.be/CLqv2rnmKb4)


### Textbook link

This video corresponds to the [textbook section - 25 Parsing dates and times](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/parsing-dates-and-times.html)


### Key Points

- Dates are a separate data type in `r rproj()`. The **tidyverse** includes functionality for dealing with dates through the **lubridate** package. 

- Extract the year, month and day from a date object with the `year()`, `month()` and `day()` functions.

- Parsers convert strings into dates with the standard YYYY-MM-DD format (ISO 8601 format). Use the parser with the name corresponding to the string format of year, month and day (`ymd()`, `ydm()`, `myd()`, `mdy()`, `dmy()`, `dym()`).

- Get the current time with the `Sys.time()` function. Use the `now()` function instead to specify a time zone.

- You can extract values from time objects with the `hour()`, `minute()` and `second()` functions.

- Parsers convert strings into times (for example, `hms()`). Parsers can also create combined date-time objects (for example, `mdy_hms()`).


### Code

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# inspect the startdate column of 2016 polls data, a Date type
library(tidyverse)
library(dslabs)
data("polls_us_election_2016")
polls_us_election_2016$startdate %>% head
class(polls_us_election_2016$startdate)
as.numeric(polls_us_election_2016$startdate) %>% head

# ggplot is aware of dates
polls_us_election_2016 %>% filter(pollster == "Ipsos" & state =="U.S.") %>%
  ggplot(aes(startdate, rawpoll_trump)) +
  geom_line()

# lubridate: the tidyverse date package
library(lubridate)

# select some random dates from polls
set.seed(2)
dates <- sample(polls_us_election_2016$startdate, 10) %>% sort
dates

# extract month, day, year from date strings
data.frame(date = dates, 
           month = month(dates),
           day = day(dates),
           year = year(dates))

month(dates, label = TRUE)    # extract month label

# ymd works on mixed date styles
x <- c(20090101, "2009-01-02", "2009 01 03", "2009-1-4",
       "2009-1, 5", "Created on 2009 1 6", "200901 !!! 07")
ymd(x)

# different parsers extract year, month and day in different orders
x <- "09/01/02"
ymd(x)
mdy(x)
ydm(x)
myd(x)
dmy(x)
dym(x)

now()    # current time in your time zone
now("GMT")    # current time in GMT
now() %>% hour()    # current hour
now() %>% minute()    # current minute
now() %>% second()    # current second

# parse time
x <- c("12:34:56")
hms(x)

#parse datetime
x <- "Nov/2/2012 12:34:56"
mdy_hms(x)
```

## Text Mining

This page corresponds to the [textbook section - Chapter 26 Text mining](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/text-mining.html)

### Key points

- The **tidytext** package helps us convert free form text into a tidy table.

- Use `unnest_tokens()` to extract individual words and other meaningful chunks of text.

- Sentiment analysis assigns emotions or a positive/negative score to tokens. You can extract sentiments using `get_sentiments()`. Common lexicons for sentiment analysis are "bing", "afinn", "nrc" and "loughran".

With the exception of labels used to represent categorical data, we have focused on numerical data, but in many applications data starts as text. Well known examples are spam filtering, cyber-crime prevention, counter-terrorism and sentiment analysis.

In all these examples, the raw data is composed of free form texts. Our task is to extract insights from these data. In this section, we learn how to generate useful numerical summaries from text data to which we can apply some of the powerful data visualization and analysis techniques we have learned.

## Case study: Trump Tweets

During the 2016 US presidential election, then-candidate Donald J. Trump used his Twitter account as a way to communicate with potential voters. On August 6, 2016 Todd Vaziri [tweeted](https://twitter.com/tvaziri/status/762005541388378112) about Trump that "Every non-hyperbolic tweet is from iPhone (his staff). Every hyperbolic tweet is from Android (from him)." Data scientist David Robinson conducted an [analysis](http://varianceexplained.org/r/trump-tweets/) to determine if data supported this assertion. Here we go through David's analysis to learn some of the basics of text mining. To learn more about text mining in R we recommend [this book](https://www.tidytextmining.com/).

We will use the following libraries

```{r, eval = FALSE}
new_research_funding_rates <- tab[6:14] %>%
  str_trim %>%
  str_split("\\s{2,}", simplify = TRUE) %>%
  data.frame(stringsAsFactors = FALSE) %>%
  setNames(the_names) %>%
  mutate_at(-1, parse_number)
new_research_funding_rates %>% head()
```

In general, we can extract data directly from Twitter using the rtweet package. However, in this case, a group has already compiled data for us and made it available at [http://www.trumptwitterarchive.com](http://www.trumptwitterarchive.com).

```{r, eval = FALSE}
url <- 'http://www.trumptwitterarchive.com/data/realdonaldtrump/%s.json'
trump_tweets <- map(2009:2017, ~sprintf(url, .x)) %>%
  map_df(jsonlite::fromJSON, simplifyDataFrame = TRUE) %>%
  filter(!is_retweet & !str_detect(text, '^"')) %>%
  mutate(created_at = parse_date_time(created_at, orders = "a b! d! H!:M!:S! z!* Y!", tz="EST")) 
```

For convenience we include the result of the code above in the dslabs package:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(dslabs)
data("trump_tweets")
```

This is data frame with information about the tweet:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
head(trump_tweets)
```

The variables that are included are:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
names(trump_tweets)
```

The help file ?trump_tweets provides details on what each variable represents. The tweets are represented by the text variable:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
trump_tweets %>% select(text) %>% head
```

and the source variable tells us the device that was used to compose and upload each tweet:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
trump_tweets %>% count(source) %>% arrange(desc(n))
```

We can use extract to remove the Twitter for part of the source and filter out retweets.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
trump_tweets %>% 
  extract(source, "source", "Twitter for (.*)") %>%
  count(source) 
```

We are interested in what happened during the campaign, so for the analysis here we will focus on what was tweeted between the day Trump announced his campaign and election day. So we define the following table:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
campaign_tweets <- trump_tweets %>% 
  extract(source, "source", "Twitter for (.*)") %>%
  filter(source %in% c("Android", "iPhone") &
           created_at >= ymd("2015-06-17") & 
           created_at < ymd("2016-11-08")) %>%
  filter(!is_retweet) %>%
  arrange(created_at)
```

We can now use data visualization to explore the possibility that two different groups were tweeting from these devices. For each tweet, we will extract the hour, in the east coast (EST), it was tweeted then compute the proportion of tweets tweeted at each hour for each device.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ds_theme_set()
campaign_tweets %>%
  mutate(hour = hour(with_tz(created_at, "EST"))) %>%
  count(source, hour) %>%
  group_by(source) %>%
  mutate(percent = n / sum(n)) %>%
  ungroup %>%
  ggplot(aes(hour, percent, color = source)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = percent_format()) +
  labs(x = "Hour of day (EST)",
       y = "% of tweets",
       color = "")
```

We notice a big peak for the Android in early hours of the morning, between 6 and 8 AM. There seems to be a clear different in these patterns. We will therefore assume that two different entities are using these two devices. Now we will study how their tweets differ. To do this we introduce the **tidytext** package.

### Text as data

The tidytext package helps us convert free from text into a tidy table. Having the data in this format greatly facilitates data visualization and applying statistical techniques.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(tidytext)
```

The main function needed to achieve this is unnest_tokens(). A token refers to the units that we are considering to be a data point. The most common tokens will be words, but they can also be single characters, ngrams, sentences, lines or a pattern defined by a regex. The functions will take a vector of strings and extract the tokens so that each one gets a row in the new table. Here is a simple example:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
example <- data_frame(line = c(1, 2, 3, 4),
                      text = c("Roses are red,", "Violets are blue,", "Sugar is sweet,", "And so are you."))
example
example %>% unnest_tokens(word, text)
```

Now let's look at a quick example with a tweet number 3008:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
i <- 3008
campaign_tweets$text[i]
campaign_tweets[i,] %>% 
  unnest_tokens(word, text) %>%
  select(word)
```

Note that the function tries to convert tokens into words and strips characters important to twitter such as # and @. A token in twitter is not the same as in regular English. For this reason, instead of using the default token, words, we define a regex that captures twitter character. The pattern appears complex but all we are defining is a patter that starts with @, # or neither and is followed by any combination of letters or digits:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
pattern <- "([^A-Za-z\\d#@']|'(?![A-Za-z\\d#@]))"
```

We can now use the unnest_tokens() function with the regex option and appropriately extract the hashtags and mentions:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
campaign_tweets[i,] %>% 
  unnest_tokens(word, text, token = "regex", pattern = pattern) %>%
  select(word)
```

Another minor adjustment we want to make is remove the links to pictures:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
campaign_tweets[i,] %>% 
  mutate(text = str_replace_all(text, "https://t.co/[A-Za-z\\d]+|&amp;", ""))  %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, text, token = "regex", pattern = pattern) %>%
  select(word)
```

Now we are ready to extract the words for all our tweets.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
tweet_words <- campaign_tweets %>% 
  mutate(text = str_replace_all(text, "https://t.co/[A-Za-z\\d]+|&amp;", ""))  %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, text, token = "regex", pattern = pattern) 
```

And we can now answer questions such as "what are the most commonly used words?"

```{r, eval = FALSE}
tweet_words %>% 
  count(word) %>%
  arrange(desc(n))
```

It is not surprising that these are the top words. The top words are not informative. The tidytext package has database of these commonly used words, referred to as stop words, in text mining:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
stop_words
```

If we filter out rows representing stop words with filter(!word %in% stop_words$word):

```{r, eval = FALSE}
tweet_words <- campaign_tweets %>% 
  mutate(text = str_replace_all(text, "https://t.co/[A-Za-z\\d]+|&amp;", ""))  %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, text, token = "regex", pattern = pattern) %>%
  filter(!word %in% stop_words$word ) 
```

We end up with a much more informative set of top 10 tweeted words:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
tweet_words %>% 
  count(word) %>%
  top_n(10, n) %>%
  mutate(word = reorder(word, n)) %>%
  arrange(desc(n))
```

Some exploration of the resulting words (not show here) reveals a couple of unwanted characteristics in our tokens. First, some of our tokens are just numbers (years for example). We want to remove these and we can find them using the regex ^\d+$. Second, some of our tokens come from a quote and they start with '. We want to remove the ' when it's at the start of a word, so we will use str_replace(). We add these two lines to the code above to generate our final table:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
tweet_words <- campaign_tweets %>% 
  mutate(text = str_replace_all(text, "https://t.co/[A-Za-z\\d]+|&amp;", ""))  %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, text, token = "regex", pattern = pattern) %>%
  filter(!word %in% stop_words$word &
           !str_detect(word, "^\\d+$")) %>%
  mutate(word = str_replace(word, "^'", ""))
```

Now that we have all our words in a table, along with information about what device was used to compose the tweet they came from, we can start exploring which words are more common when comparing Android to iPhone.

For each word we want to know if it is more likely to come from an Android tweet or an iPhone tweet. We previously introduced the odds ratio, a summary statistic useful for quantifying these differences. For each device and a given word, let's call it y, we compute the odds or the ratio between the proportion of words that are y and not y and compute the ratio of those odds. Here we will have many proportions that are 0 so we use the 0.5 correction.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
android_iphone_or <- tweet_words %>%
  count(word, source) %>%
  spread(source, n, fill = 0) %>%
  mutate(or = (Android + 0.5) / (sum(Android) - Android + 0.5) / 
           ( (iPhone + 0.5) / (sum(iPhone) - iPhone + 0.5)))
android_iphone_or %>% arrange(desc(or))
android_iphone_or %>% arrange(or)
```

Given that several of these words are overall low frequency words we can impose a filter based on the total frequency like this:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
android_iphone_or %>% filter(Android+iPhone > 100) %>%
  arrange(desc(or))

android_iphone_or %>% filter(Android+iPhone > 100) %>%
  arrange(or)
```

We already see somewhat of a pattern in the types of words that are being tweeted more in one device versus the other. However, we are not interested in specific words but rather in the tone. Vaziri's assertion is that the Android tweets are more hyperbolic. So how can we check this with data? Hyperbolic is a hard sentiment to extract from words as it relies on interpreting phrases. However, words can be associated to more basic sentiment such as as anger, fear, joy and surprise. In the next section we demonstrate basic sentiment analysis.

### Sentiment Analysis

In sentiment analysis we assign a word to one or more "sentiment". Although this approach will miss context dependent sentiments, such as sarcasm, when performed on large numbers of words, summaries can provide insights.

The first step in sentiment analysis is to assign a sentiment to each word. The tidytext package includes several maps or lexicons in the object sentiments:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
sentiments

There are several lexicons in the tidytext package that give different sentiments. For example, the bing lexicon divides words into positive and negative. We can see this using the tidytext function get_sentiments():

```{r, eval = FALSE}
get_sentiments("bing")
```

The AFINN lexicon assigns a score between -5 and 5, with -5 the most negative and 5 the most positive.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
get_sentiments("afinn")
```

The loughran and nrc lexicons provide several different sentiments:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
get_sentiments("loughran") %>% count(sentiment)
get_sentiments("nrc") %>% count(sentiment)
```

To start learning about how these lexicons were developed, read this help file: ?sentiments.

For the analysis here we are interested in exploring the different sentiments of each tweet, so we will use the nrc lexicon:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
nrc <- get_sentiments("nrc") %>%
  select(word, sentiment)
```

We can combine the words and sentiments using inner_join(), which will only keep words associated with a sentiment. Here are 10 random words extracted from the tweets:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
tweet_words %>% inner_join(nrc, by = "word") %>% 
  select(source, word, sentiment) %>% sample_n(10)
```

Now we are ready to perform a quantitative analysis comparing Android and iPhone by comparing the sentiments of the tweets posted from each device. Here we could perform a tweet by tweet analysis, assigning a sentiment to each tweet. However, this somewhat complex since each tweet will have several sentiments attached to it, one for each word appearing in the lexicon. For illustrative purposes, we will perform a much simpler analysis: we will count and compare the frequencies of each sentiment appears for each device.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
sentiment_counts <- tweet_words %>%
  left_join(nrc, by = "word") %>%
  count(source, sentiment) %>%
  spread(source, n) %>%
  mutate(sentiment = replace_na(sentiment, replace = "none"))
sentiment_counts
```

Because more words were used on the Android than on the phone:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
tweet_words %>% group_by(source) %>% summarize(n = n())
```

for each sentiment we can compute the odds of being in the device: proportion of words with sentiment versus proportion of words without and then compute the odds ratio comparing the two devices:

```{r, eval = FALSE}

sentiment_counts %>%
  mutate(Android = Android / (sum(Android) - Android) , 
         iPhone = iPhone / (sum(iPhone) - iPhone), 
         or = Android/iPhone) %>%
  arrange(desc(or))
```

So we do see some difference and the order is interesting: the largest three sentiments are disgust, anger, and negative! But are they statistically significant? How does this compare if we are just assigning sentiments at random?

To answer that question we can compute, for each sentiment, an odds ratio and confidence interval. We will add the two values we need to form a two-by-two table and the odds ratio:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(broom)
log_or <- sentiment_counts %>%
  mutate( log_or = log( (Android / (sum(Android) - Android)) / (iPhone / (sum(iPhone) - iPhone))),
          se = sqrt( 1/Android + 1/(sum(Android) - Android) + 1/iPhone + 1/(sum(iPhone) - iPhone)),
          conf.low = log_or - qnorm(0.975)*se,
          conf.high = log_or + qnorm(0.975)*se) %>%
  arrange(desc(log_or))
  
log_or
```

A graphical visualization shows some sentiments that are clearly overrepresented:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
log_or %>%
  mutate(sentiment = reorder(sentiment, log_or),) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = sentiment, ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high)) +
  geom_errorbar() +
  geom_point(aes(sentiment, log_or)) +
  ylab("Log odds ratio for association between Android and sentiment") +
  coord_flip() 
```

We see that the disgust, anger, negative sadness and fear sentiments are associated with the Android in a way that is hard to explain by chance alone. Words not associated to a sentiment were strongly associated with the iPhone source, which is in agreement with the original claim about hyperbolic tweets.

If we are interested in exploring which specific words are driving these differences, we can back to our android_iphone_or object:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
android_iphone_or %>% inner_join(nrc) %>%
  filter(sentiment == "disgust" & Android + iPhone > 10) %>%
  arrange(desc(or))

```

We can make a graph:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
android_iphone_or %>% inner_join(nrc, by = "word") %>%
  mutate(sentiment = factor(sentiment, levels = log_or$sentiment)) %>%
  mutate(log_or = log(or)) %>%
  filter(Android + iPhone > 10 & abs(log_or)>1) %>%
  mutate(word = reorder(word, log_or)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(word, log_or, fill = log_or < 0)) +
  facet_wrap(~sentiment, scales = "free_x", nrow = 2) + 
  geom_bar(stat="identity", show.legend = FALSE) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) 
```

## Course Final Project

On September 20, 2017, Hurricane María made landfall on Puerto Rico. It was the worst natural disaster on record in Puerto Rico and the deadliest Atlantic hurricane since 2004. However, Puerto Rico's official death statistics only tallied 64 deaths caused directly by the hurricane (due to structural collapse, debris, floods and drownings), an undercount that slowed disaster recovery funding. The majority of the deaths resulted from infrastructure damage that made it difficult to access resources like clean food, water, power, healthcare and communications in the months after the disaster, and although these deaths were due to effects of the hurricane, they were not initially counted.

In order to correct the misconception that few lives were lost in Hurricane María, statisticians analyzed how death rates in Puerto Rico changed after the hurricane and estimated the excess number of deaths likely caused by the storm. [This analysis](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16X9qtnPaD--2dPhpcwu7S53esafH59i9/preview) suggested that the actual number of deaths in Puerto Rico was 2,975 (95% CI: 2,658-3,290) over the 4 months following the hurricane, much higher than the original count.

We will use your new data wrangling skills to extract actual daily mortality data from Puerto Rico and investigate whether the Hurricane María had an immediate effect on daily mortality compared to unaffected days in September 2015-2017.
