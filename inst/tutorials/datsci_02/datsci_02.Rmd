### Welcome to the Data Science: Visualization Course!

We're excited to have you join us in this course, which is designed to teach you data visualization techniques to communicate data-driven findings.

This is the second in a series of courses in the Introduction to Data Science program. The courses in the program are designed to prepare you to do data analysis in `r rproj()`, from simple computations to machine learning. If you need a refresher of some basic `r rproj()`, check out *Data Science: R Basics*, the first course in this series.

This course assumes you are comfortable with basic math, algebra, and logical operations. We have partnered with DataCamp for some assignments in `r rproj()` that allow you to program directly in a browser-based interface. You will further have access to additional exercises to be completed on your local installation of `r rproj()`.

Using a combination of a guided introduction through short video lectures and more independent in-depth exploration, you will get to practice your new `r rproj()` skills on real-life applications.

The growing availability of informative datasets and software tools has led to increased reliance on data visualizations across many industries, academia, and government. Data visualization provides a powerful way to communicate data-driven findings, motivate analyses, or detect flaws. In this course, you will learn the basics of data visualization and exploratory data analysis. We will use three motivating examples and ggplot2, a data visualization package for the statistical programming language `r rproj()`, to code. To learn the very basics, we will start with a somewhat artificial example: heights reported by students. Then we will explore two case studies related to world health and economics and another in infectious disease trends in the United States. It is also important to note that mistakes, biases, systematic errors, and other unexpected problems often lead to data that should be handled with care. The fact that it can be difficult or impossible to notice an error just from the reported results makes data visualization particularly important. This course will explore how failure to discover these problems often leads to flawed analyses and false discoveries.

### In this course, you will learn:

- Data visualization principles to better communicate data-driven findings
- How to use **ggplot2** to create custom plots
- The weaknesses of several widely used plots and why you should avoid them

### Course overview

**Section 1:** Introduction to Data Visualization and Distributions

- You will get started with data visualization and distributions in `r rproj()`.

**Section 2:** Introduction to ggplot2

### Essential Course Information

#### **Course Objectives**

“Data science” is a catch-all term used to describe the practice of working with and analyzing messy data sources to draw meaningful conclusions using techniques developed by computer scientists and computational statisticians. The purpose of this course is to give students who are training as quantitative social scientists a broad introduction to this skillset via the statistical programming language, `r rproj()`. You will learn how to conduct many statistical analyses such as univariate statistics (e.g., ANOVA, correlation, regression) in `r rproj()` that you may have already done in SPSS, Excel, or another such program. Additionally, we will build on this foundation to explore new skillsets uncommon in the social sciences, such as natural language processing, automated data curation, and machine learning. 

At the end of this course you will be able to:

- To answer research questions in Social Sciences (e.g., Psychology) with data

- Understand the basics of research designs in Social Sciences, and how they relate to data-analysis strategies

- Develop an intuitive, practical, and conceptual understanding of strategies for asking and answering questions with data

- To use `r rproj()`, a free and open-source statistics software program.

- Develop a basic understanding of frequently used Data Science Techniques.

- Practice your newly acquired skills with interesting, interactive, and fun projects.

**NOTE**: The schedule and procedures described in this syllabus are subject to change depending on specific needs and requirements. You will always be notified of changes on the homepage (see “last update”).


#### **Course Structure**

This is the first module in a series of a 8 week-intensive course.  and I suggest that you devote approx 10 hours a week to learning `r rproj()`, or if you are teaching graduate students, I’d recommend adopting the schedule below, which is designed for an intense but doable semester-long course, one module per week.  It is intended to take the average graduate student roughly 10 hours per week to complete all required tasks.However, some number of students will find programming to be more challenging and may take up to 15 hours per week.  Some will breeze through the material in 5.

#### **Grading**

Each Monday, lessons will be assigned from datacamp.com. Some of these lessons will be complete DataCamp courses, and others will be specific modules of courses. This will all be managed by assigning content to your (free) DataCamp account. The amount of content assigned will vary between one and two courses of content. DataCamp considers a course to be roughly 4 hours of lessons, which includes practice time. Realistically, the time you need will depend upon how intuitive you find `r rproj()` to be. For students already familiar with other programming languages and those with previous `r rproj()` experience, “8 hours” of courses is realistically closer to 2 hours; for complete novices that also find the material difficult, 8 hours is a realistic estimate. It is strongly recommended that you stretch out DataCamp lessons across the assignment period, for example, allocating 1 hour each day. You will gain the most by treating this as a foreign language immersion course by using R every day, including for your own research.
Remember that you can always go to the **Slack Group** for help. 

#### **Passing Rate**

The passing rate is 70%.

### 1.1.1 Introduction to Data Visualization
Looking at the numbers and character strings that define a dataset is rarely useful. To convince yourself, print and stare at the US murders data table:

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(dslabs)
data(murders)
head(murders)
```

What do you learn from staring at this table? How quickly can you determine which states have the largest populations? Which states have the smallest? How large is a typical state? Is there a relationship between population size and total murders? How do murder rates vary across regions of the country?  For most human brains, it is quite difficult to extract this information just by looking at the numbers. In contrast, the answer to all the questions above are readily available from examining this plot: 

<center>

```{r ggplot-example-plot-0, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggthemes)
library(ggrepel)

r <- murders %>% 
  summarize(pop=sum(population), tot=sum(total)) %>% 
  mutate(rate = tot/pop*10^6) %>% pull(rate)

murders %>% ggplot(aes(x = population/10^6, y = total, label = abb)) +  
  geom_abline(intercept = log10(r), lty=2, col="darkgrey") +
  geom_point(aes(color=region), size = 3) +
  geom_text_repel() + 
  scale_x_log10() +
  scale_y_log10() +
  xlab("Populations in millions (log scale)") + 
  ylab("Total number of murders (log scale)") +
  ggtitle("US Gun Murders in 2010") +
  scale_color_discrete(name="Region") +
  theme_economist()
```

</center>

We are reminded of the saying "a picture is worth a thousand words". Data visualization provides a powerful way to communicate a data-driven finding. In some cases, the visualization is so convincing that no follow-up analysis is required. 

The growing availability of informative datasets and software tools has led to increased reliance on data visualizations across many industries, academia, and government. A salient example is news organizations, which are increasingly embracing _data journalism_ and including effective _infographics_ as part of their reporting. 

A particularly effective example is a [Wall Street Journal article](http://graphics.wsj.com/infectious-diseases-and-vaccines/?mc_cid=711ddeb86e) showing data related to the impact of vaccines on battling infectious diseases. One of the graphs shows measles cases by US state through the years with a vertical line demonstrating when the vaccine was introduced.

```{r wsj-vaccines-example, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.height=5}
#knitr::include_graphics(file.path(img_path,"wsj-vaccines.png"))
data(us_contagious_diseases)
the_disease <- "Measles"
dat <- us_contagious_diseases %>%
  filter(!state%in%c("Hawaii","Alaska") & disease == the_disease) %>%
  mutate(rate = count / population * 10000 * 52 / weeks_reporting) %>%
  mutate(state = reorder(state, rate))

jet.colors <-
colorRampPalette(c("#F0FFFF", "cyan", "#007FFF", "yellow", "#FFBF00", "orange", "red", "#7F0000"), bias = 2.25)

dat %>% ggplot(aes(year, state, fill = rate)) +
  geom_tile(color = "white", size=0.35) +
  scale_x_continuous(expand=c(0,0)) +
  scale_fill_gradientn(colors = jet.colors(16), na.value = 'white') +
  geom_vline(xintercept=1963, col = "black") +
  theme_minimal() + 
  theme(panel.grid = element_blank()) +
  coord_cartesian(clip = 'off') +
  ggtitle(the_disease) +
  ylab("") +
  xlab("") +  
  theme(legend.position = "bottom", text = element_text(size = 8)) + 
  annotate(geom = "text", x = 1963, y = 50.5, label = "Vaccine introduced", size = 3, hjust=0)
```

Another striking example comes from a [New York Times chart](http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2011/02/19/nyregion/19schoolsch/19schoolsch-popup.gif), which summarizes scores from the NYC Regents Exams. As described in 
the [article](https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/19/nyregion/19schools.html), these scores are collected for several reasons, including to determine if a student graduates from high school. In New York City you need a 65 to pass. The distribution of the test scores forces us to notice something somewhat problematic:

  <center>
  
```{r regents-exams-example, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, out.width="80%", fig.height=2.5}
#knitr::include_graphics(file.path(img_path,"nythist.png"))
data("nyc_regents_scores")
nyc_regents_scores$total <- rowSums(nyc_regents_scores[,-1], na.rm=TRUE)

nyc_regents_scores %>% 
  filter(!is.na(score)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(score, total)) + 
  annotate("rect", xmin = 65, xmax = 99, ymin = 0, ymax = 35000, alpha = .5) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", color = "black", fill = "#C4843C") + 
  annotate("text", x = 66, y = 28000, label = "MINIMUM\nREGENTS DIPLOMA\nSCORE IS 65", hjust = 0, size = 3) +
  annotate("text", x = 0, y = 12000, label = "2010 Regents scores on\nthe five most common tests", hjust = 0, size = 3) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(5, 95, 5), limit = c(0,99)) + 
  scale_y_continuous(position = "right") +
  ggtitle("Scraping by") + 
  xlab("") + ylab("Number of tests") + 
  theme_minimal() + 
  theme(panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(), 
        panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.length = unit(-0.2, "cm"),
        plot.title = element_text(face = "bold"))
```

  </center>
<!--(Source: [New York Times](http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2011/02/19/nyregion/19schoolsch/19schoolsch-popup.gif) via Amanda Cox)-->

The most common test score is the minimum passing grade, with very few scores just below the threshold. This unexpected result is consistent with students close to passing having their scores bumped up.

This is an example of how data visualization can lead to discoveries which would otherwise be missed if we simply subjected the data to a battery of data analysis tools or procedures. Data visualization is the strongest tool of what we call _exploratory data analysis_ (EDA). [John W. Tukey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Tukey), considered the father of EDA, once said,

>> "The greatest value of a picture is when it forces us to notice what we never 
expected to see." 

Many widely used data analysis tools were initiated by discoveries made via EDA. EDA is perhaps the most important part of data analysis, yet it is one that is often overlooked.

Data visualization is also now pervasive in philanthropic and educational organizations. In the talks [New Insights on Poverty](https://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_reveals_new_insights_on_poverty?language=en) and [The Best Stats You've Ever Seen](https://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_shows_the_best_stats_you_ve_ever_seen), Hans Rosling forces us to notice the unexpected with a series of plots related to world health and economics. In his videos, he uses animated graphs to show us how the world is changing and how old narratives are no longer true.

<center>

```{r gampnider-example-plot, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
data(gapminder)

west <- c("Western Europe","Northern Europe","Southern Europe",
          "Northern America","Australia and New Zealand")

gapminder <- gapminder %>% 
  mutate(group = case_when(
    region %in% west ~ "The West",
    region %in% c("Eastern Asia", "South-Eastern Asia") ~ "East Asia",
    region %in% c("Caribbean", "Central America", "South America") ~ "Latin America",
    continent == "Africa" & region != "Northern Africa" ~ "Sub-Saharan Africa",
    TRUE ~ "Others"))
gapminder <- gapminder %>% 
  mutate(group = factor(group, levels = rev(c("Others", "Latin America", "East Asia","Sub-Saharan Africa", "The West"))))

years <- c(1962, 2013)
p <- filter(gapminder, year%in%years & !is.na(group) & 
         !is.na(fertility) & !is.na(life_expectancy)) %>%
  mutate(population_in_millions = population/10^6) %>%
  ggplot( aes(fertility, y=life_expectancy, col = group, size = population_in_millions)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.8) +
  guides(size=FALSE) +
  theme(plot.title = element_blank(), legend.title = element_blank()) + 
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(30, 85)) + 
  xlab("Fertility rate (births per woman)") +
  ylab("Life Expectancy") + 
  geom_text(aes(x=7, y=82, label=year), cex=12, color="grey") +
  facet_grid(. ~ year)
    
p + theme(strip.background = element_blank(),
    strip.text.x = element_blank(),
   strip.text.y = element_blank(),
   legend.position = "top")
```

</center>

It is also important to note that mistakes, biases, systematic errors and other unexpected problems often lead to data that should be handled with care. Failure to discover these problems can give rise to flawed analyses and false discoveries. As an example, consider that measurement devices sometimes fail and that most data analysis procedures are not designed to detect these. 
Yet these data analysis procedures will still give you an answer. The fact that it can be difficult or impossible to notice an error just from the reported results makes data visualization particularly important.

In this part of the book, we will learn the basics of data visualization and exploratory data analysis by using three motivating examples. We will use the __ggplot2__ package to code. To learn the very basics, we will start with a somewhat artificial example: heights reported by students. Then we will cover the two examples mentioned above: 1) world health and economics and 2) infectious disease trends in the United States.

### 1.1.2 Introduction to Distributions

<div class="infobox">
  
  **Textbook link** The contents are discussed within the [textbook section 8. Visualizing data distributions](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/distributions.html).
  
</div>

You may have noticed that numerical data is often summarized with the _average_ value. For example, the quality of a high school is sometimes summarized with one number: the average score on a standardized test. Occasionally, a second number is reported: the _standard deviation_. For example, you might read a report stating that scores were 680 plus or minus 50 (the standard deviation). The report has summarized an entire vector of scores with just two numbers. Is this appropriate? Is there any important piece of information that we are missing by only looking at this summary rather than the entire list? 

Our first data visualization building block is learning to summarize lists of factors or numeric vectors. More often than not, the best way to share or explore this summary is through data visualization. The most basic statistical summary of a list of objects or numbers is its distribution. Once a vector has been summarized as a distribution, there are several data visualization techniques to effectively relay this information.

In this module, we first discuss properties of a variety of distributions and how to visualize distributions using a motivating example of student heights. We then discuss the __ggplot2__ geometries for these visualizations in an upcoming module (other-geometries).

---

### 1.1.3 Data Types

We will be working with two types of variables: categorical and numeric. Each can be divided into two other groups: categorical can be ordinal or not, whereas numerical variables can be discrete or continuous.

When each entry in a vector comes from one of a small number of groups, we refer to the data as _categorical data_. Two simple examples are sex (male or female) and regions (Northeast, South, North Central, West). Some categorical data can be ordered even if they are not numbers per se, such as spiciness (mild, medium, hot). In statistics textbooks, ordered categorical data are referred to as _ordinal_ data. 

Examples of numerical data are population sizes, murder rates, and heights. Some numerical data can be treated as ordered categorical. We can further divide numerical data into continuous and discrete. Continuous variables are those that can take any value, such as heights, if measured with enough precision. For example, a pair of twins may be 68.12 and 68.11 inches, respectively. Counts, such as population sizes, are discrete because they have to be round numbers.

Keep in mind that discrete numeric data can be considered ordinal. Although this is technically true, we usually reserve the term ordinal data for variables belonging to a small number of different groups, with each group having many members. In contrast, when we have many groups with few cases in each group, we typically refer to them as discrete numerical variables. So, for example, the number of packs of cigarettes a person smokes a day, rounded to the closest pack, would be considered ordinal, while the actual number of cigarettes would be considered a numerical variable. But, indeed, there are examples that can be considered both numerical and ordinal when it comes to visualizing data.

### 1.2 Describe Heights to ET

<div class="infobox">
  
  **Textbook link** The contents are discussed within the [textbook sections 8.2 Case study of describing student heights](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/distributions.html#case-study-describing-student-heights) trough [textbook section - 8.5 Histograms](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/distributions.html#histograms).
  
</div>

--- 

Here we introduce a new motivating problem. It is an artificial one, but it will help us illustrate the concepts needed to understand distributions. 

Pretend that we have to describe the heights of our classmates to ET, an extraterrestrial that has never seen humans. As a first step, we need to collect data. To do this, we ask students to report their heights in inches. We ask them to provide sex information because we know there are two different distributions by sex. We collect the data and save it in the `heights` data frame:

```{r load-heights, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(dslabs)
data(heights)
```

One way to convey the heights to ET is to simply send him this list of `r nrow(heights)` heights. But there are much more effective ways to convey this information, and understanding the concept of a distribution will help. To simplify the explanation, we first focus on male heights. We examine the female height data in Section on "student heights".

### 1.2.1 Distribution function

It turns out that, in some cases, the average and the standard deviation are pretty much all we need to understand the data. We will learn data visualization techniques that will help us determine when this two number summary is appropriate. These same techniques will serve as an alternative for when two numbers are not enough.

The most basic statistical summary of a list of objects or numbers is its distribution. The simplest way to think of a distribution is as a compact description of a list with many entries. This concept should not be new for readers of this book. For example, with categorical data, the distribution simply describes the proportion of each unique category. The sex represented in the heights dataset is:

```{r echo = FALSE}
prop.table(table(heights$sex))
```

This two-category _frequency table_ is the simplest form of a distribution. We don't really need to visualize it since one number describes everything we need to know: `r round(mean(heights$sex=="Female")*100)`% are females and the rest are males. When there are more categories, then a simple barplot describes the distribution. Here is an example with US state regions:

<center>

```{r state-region-distribution, echo=FALSE}
murders %>% group_by(region) %>%
  summarize(n = n()) %>%
  mutate(Proportion = n/sum(n), 
         region = reorder(region, Proportion)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=region, y=Proportion, fill=region)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", show.legend = FALSE) + 
  xlab("")
```

</center>

This particular plot simply shows us four numbers, one for each category. We usually use barplots to display a few numbers. Although this particular plot does not provide much more insight than a frequency table itself, it is a first example of how we convert a vector into a plot that succinctly summarizes all the information in the vector. When the data is numerical, the task of displaying distributions is more challenging.  

---

### 1.2.2 Cumulative distribution functions 

Numerical data that are not categorical also have distributions. In general, when data is not categorical, reporting the frequency of each entry is not an effective summary since most entries are unique. In our case study, while several students reported a height of 68 inches, only one student reported a height of `68.503937007874` inches and  only one student reported a height `68.8976377952756` inches. We assume that they converted from 174 and 175 centimeters, respectively.

Statistics textbooks teach us that a more useful way to define a distribution for numeric data is to define a function that reports the proportion of the data below $a$ for all possible values of $a$. This function is called the cumulative distribution function (CDF). In statistics, the following notation is used:

$$ F(a) = \mbox{Pr}(x \leq a) $$

Here is a plot of $F$ for the male height data:

<center>

```{r ecdf, echo=FALSE}
ds_theme_set()
heights %>% filter(sex=="Male") %>% ggplot(aes(height)) + 
  stat_ecdf() +
  ylab("F(a)") + xlab("a")
```

</center>

Similar to what the frequency table does for categorical data, the CDF
defines the distribution for numerical data. From the plot, we can see that `r round(ecdf(heights$height[heights$sex=="Male"])(66)*100)`% of the values are below 65, since $F(66)=$ `r ecdf(heights$height[heights$sex=="Male"])(66)`, or that `r round(ecdf(heights$height[heights$sex=="Male"])(72)*100)`% of the values are below 72, since $F(72)=$ `r ecdf(heights$height[heights$sex=="Male"])(72)`, 
and so on. In fact, we can report the proportion of values between any two heights, say $a$ and $b$, by computing $F(b) - F(a)$. This means that if we send this plot above to ET, he will have all the information needed to reconstruct the entire list. Paraphrasing the expression "a picture is worth a thousand words", in this case, a picture is as informative as `r sum(heights$sex=="Male")` numbers. 

A final note: because CDFs can be defined mathematically the word _empirical_ is added to make the distinction when data is used.  We therefore use the term empirical CDF (eCDF). 

--- 

### 1.2.3 Histograms

Although the CDF concept is widely discussed in statistics textbooks, the plot is actually not very popular in practice. The main reason is that it does not easily convey characteristics of interest such as: at what value is the distribution centered? Is the distribution symmetric? What ranges contain 95% of the values? Histograms are much preferred because they greatly facilitate answering such questions. Histograms sacrifice just a bit of information to produce plots that are much easier to interpret. 

The simplest way to make a histogram is to divide the span of our data into non-overlapping bins of the same size. Then, for each bin, we count the number of values that fall in that interval. The histogram plots these counts as bars with the base of the bar defined by the intervals. Here is the histogram for the height data splitting the range of values into one inch intervals: $(49.5, 50.5],(50.5, 51.5],(51.5,52.5],(52.5,53.5],...,(82.5,83.5]$

<center>

```{r height-histogram, echo=FALSE}
heights %>% 
  filter(sex=="Male") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(height)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, color = "black")
```

</center>

As you can see in the figure above, a histogram is similar to a barplot, but it differs in that the x-axis is numerical, not categorical.

If we send this plot to ET, he will immediately learn some important properties about our data. First, the range of the data is from 50 to 84 with the majority (more than 95%) between 63 and 75 inches. Second, the heights are close to symmetric around 69 inches. Also, by adding up counts, ET could obtain a very good approximation of the proportion of the data in any interval. Therefore, the histogram above is not only easy to interpret, but also provides almost all the information contained in the raw list of `r sum(heights$sex=="Male")` heights with about 30 bin counts.

What information do we lose?  Note that all values in each interval are treated the same when computing bin heights. So, for example, the histogram does not distinguish between 64, 64.1, and 64.2 inches. Given that these differences are almost unnoticeable to the eye, the practical implications are negligible and we were able to summarize the data to just 23 numbers.

We discuss how to code histograms in Section "other-geometries".

### 1.2.4 Cumulative Distribution Function

Every continuous distribution has a cumulative distribution function (CDF). The CDF defines the proportion of the data below a given value 𝑎 for all values of 𝑎:
    
<center>
     
𝐹(𝑎) = Pr(𝑥 ≤ 𝑎)
    
</center>
      
Any continuous dataset has a CDF, not only normal distributions. For example, the male heights data we used in the previous section has this CDF:
  
<center>
  
<figure>
<img src="./images/CDF.png" alt="R Studio" style="width:800px">
</figure> 

</center>
  
This plot of the CDF for male heights has height values "a" on the x-axis and the proportion of students with heights of that value or lower on the y-axis.

As defined above, this plot of the CDF for male heights has height values 𝑎 on the x-axis and the proportion of students with heights of that value or lower (𝐹(𝑎)) on the y-axis.

The CDF is essential for calculating probabilities related to continuous data. In a continuous dataset, the probability of a specific exact value is not informative because most entries are unique. For example, in the student heights data, only one individual reported a height of 68.8976377952726 inches, but many students rounded similar heights to 69 inches. If we computed exact value probabilities, we would find that being exactly 69 inches is much more likely than being a non-integer exact height, which does not match our understanding that height is continuous. We can instead use the CDF to obtain a useful summary, such as the probability that a student is between 68.5 and 69.5 inches. 

For datasets that are not normal, the CDF can be calculated manually by defining a function to compute the probability above. This function can then be applied to a range of values across the range of the dataset to calculate a CDF. Given a dataset my_data, the CDF can be calculated and plotted like this:


```{r, eval = FALSE}
a <- seq(min(my_data), max(my_data), length = 100)    # define range of values spanning the dataset
cdf_function <- function(x) {    # computes prob. for a single value
    mean(my_data <= x)
}
cdf_values <- sapply(a, cdf_function)
plot(a, cdf_values)
```

The CDF defines that proportion of data below a cutoff 𝑎. To define the proportion of values above 𝑎, we compute:
   
<center>
    
1 − 𝐹(𝑎)

</center>
    
To define the proportion of values between 𝑎 and 𝑏, we compute:

<center>
      
𝐹(𝑏) − 𝐹(𝑎)

</center>
    
Note that the CDF can help compute probabilities. The probability of observing a randomly chosen value between 𝑎 and 𝑏 is equal to the proportion of values between 𝑎 and 𝑏, which we compute with the CDF.

### 1.2.5 Smooth Density Plots


Smooth density plots are aesthetically more appealing than histograms. Here is what a smooth density plot looks like for our heights data:

<center>

```{r example-of-smoothed-density, echo=FALSE}
heights %>% 
  filter(sex=="Male") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(height)) + 
  geom_density(alpha = .2, fill= "#00BFC4", color = 0)  +
  geom_line(stat='density')
```

</center>

In this plot, we no longer have sharp edges at the interval boundaries and many of the local peaks have been removed. Also, the scale of the y-axis changed from counts to _density_.

To understand the smooth densities, we have to understand _estimates_, a topic we don't cover until later. However, we provide a heuristic explanation to help you understand the basics so you can use this useful data visualization tool.

The main new concept you must understand is that we assume that our list of observed values is a subset of a much larger list of unobserved values. In the case of heights, you can imagine that our list of `r sum(heights$sex=="Male")` male students comes from a hypothetical list containing all the heights of all the male students in all the world measured very precisely. Let's say there are 1,000,000 of these measurements. This list of values has a distribution, like any list of values, and this larger distribution is really what we want to report to ET since it is much more general. Unfortunately, we don't get to see it. 

However, we make an assumption that helps us perhaps approximate it. If we had 1,000,000 values, measured very precisely, we could make a histogram with very, very small bins. The assumption is that if we show this, the height of consecutive bins will be similar. This is what we mean by smooth: we don't have big jumps in the heights of consecutive bins. Below we have a hypothetical histogram with bins of size 1:
 
<center>

```{r simulated-data-histogram-1, echo=FALSE}
set.seed(1988)
x <- data.frame(height = c(rnorm(1000000,69,3), rnorm(1000000,65,3)))
x %>% ggplot(aes(height)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, color = "black")
```

</center>

The smaller we make the bins, the smoother the histogram gets. Here are the histograms with bin width of 1, 0.5, and 0.1:

```{r simulated-data-histogram-2, fig.width=9, fig.height=3,  out.width = "100%",echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
p1 <- x %>% ggplot(aes(height)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, color = "black") + ggtitle("binwidth=1")
p2 <- x %>% ggplot(aes(height)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.5, color="black") + ggtitle("binwidth=0.5") 
p3 <- x %>% ggplot(aes(height)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.1) + ggtitle("binwidth=0.1")
library(gridExtra)
grid.arrange(p1, p2, p3, nrow = 1)
```

The smooth density is basically the curve that goes through the top of the histogram bars when the bins are very, very small. To make the curve not depend on the hypothetical size of the hypothetical list, we compute the curve on frequencies rather than counts:

<center>

```{r, simulated-density-1, echo=FALSE}
x %>% ggplot(aes(height)) + 
  geom_histogram(aes(y=..density..), binwidth = 0.1, color = I("black")) +
  geom_line(stat='density')
```

</center>

Now, back to reality. We don't have millions of measurements. Instead, we have `r sum(heights$sex=="Male")` and we can't make a histogram with very small bins. 

We therefore make a histogram, using bin sizes appropriate for our data and computing frequencies rather than counts, and we draw a smooth curve that goes through the tops of the histogram bars. The following plots demonstrate the steps that lead to a smooth density:

```{r smooth-density-2, echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
hist1 <- heights %>% 
  filter(sex=="Male") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(height)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(y=..density..), binwidth = 1, color="black") 
hist2 <- hist1 +
  geom_line(stat='density')
hist3 <- hist1 + 
  geom_point(data = ggplot_build(hist2)$data[[1]], aes(x,y), col = "blue")
hist4 <- ggplot() + geom_point(data = ggplot_build(hist2)$data[[1]], aes(x,y), col = "blue") + 
  xlab("height") + ylab("density")
hist5 <- hist4 + geom_line(data = ggplot_build(hist2)$data[[2]], aes(x,y))
hist6 <- heights %>% 
  filter(sex=="Male") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(height)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.2, fill="#00BFC4", col = 0) +
  geom_line(stat='density') +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = layer_scales(hist2)$y$range$range)
  
grid.arrange(hist1, hist3, hist4, hist5, hist2, hist6, nrow=2)
```

However, remember that _smooth_ is a relative term. We can actually control the _smoothness_ of the curve that defines the smooth density through an option in the function that computes the smooth density curve. Here are two examples using different degrees of smoothness on the same histogram:


```{r densities-different-smoothness, echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.width = 6, fig.height = 3}
p1 <- heights %>% 
  filter(sex=="Male")%>% ggplot(aes(height)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(y=..density..), binwidth = 1, alpha = 0.5) + 
  geom_line(stat='density', adjust = 0.5)

p2 <- heights %>% 
  filter(sex=="Male") %>% ggplot(aes(height)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(y=..density..), binwidth = 1, alpha = 0.5) + 
  geom_line(stat='density', adjust = 2)

grid.arrange(p1,p2, ncol=2)
```
We need to make this choice with care as the resulting visualizations can change our interpretation of the data. We should select a degree of smoothness that we can defend as being representative of the underlying data. In the case of height, we really do have reason to believe that the proportion of people with similar heights should be the same. For example, the proportion that is 72 inches should be more similar to the proportion that is 71 than to the proportion that is 78 or 65. This implies that the curve should be pretty smooth; that is, the curve should look more like the example on the right than on the left.

While the histogram is an assumption-free summary, the smoothed density is based on some assumptions. 

### 1.2.5.1 Interpreting the y-axis 

Note that interpreting the y-axis of a smooth density plot is not straightforward. It is scaled so that the area under the density curve adds up to 1. If you imagine we form a bin with a base 1 unit in length, the y-axis value tells us the proportion of values in that bin. However, this is only true for bins of size 1. For other size intervals, the best way to determine the proportion of data in that interval is by computing the proportion of the total area contained in that interval. For example, here are the proportion of values between 65 and 68:

<center>

```{r area-under-curve, echo=FALSE}
d <- with(heights, density(height[sex=="Male"]))
tmp <- data.frame(height=d$x, density=d$y)
tmp %>% ggplot(aes(height,density)) + geom_line() + 
  geom_area(aes(x=height,y=density), data = filter(tmp, between(height, 65, 68)), alpha=0.2, fill="#00BFC4")
```

</center>

The proportion of this area is about 
`r round(mean(dplyr::between(heights$height[heights$sex=="Male"], 65, 68)), 2)`, 
meaning that about 
`r noquote(paste0(round(mean(dplyr::between(heights$height[heights$sex=="Male"], 65, 68)), 2)*100, '%'))`
of male heights are between 65 and 68 inches.

By understanding this, we are ready to use the smooth density as a summary. For this dataset, we would feel quite comfortable with the smoothness assumption, and therefore with sharing this aesthetically pleasing figure with ET, which he could use to understand our male heights data:

<center>

```{r example-of-smoothed-density-2, echo=FALSE}
heights %>% 
  filter(sex=="Male") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(height)) + 
  geom_density(alpha=.2, fill= "#00BFC4", color = 0)  +
  geom_line(stat='density')
```

</center>

### 1.2.5.2 Densities permit stratification 

As a final note, we point out that an advantage of smooth densities over histograms for visualization purposes is that densities make it easier to compare two distributions. This is in large part because the jagged edges of the histogram add clutter. Here is an example comparing male and female heights:

<center>

```{r two-densities-one-plot, echo=FALSE}
heights %>% 
  ggplot(aes(height, fill=sex)) + 
  geom_density(alpha = 0.2, color = 0) +
  geom_line(stat='density')
```

</center>

With the right argument, `ggplot` automatically shades the intersecting region with a different color. We will show examples of __ggplot2__ code for densities in Section \@ref(gapminder) as well as Section \@ref(other-geometries).

### 1.2.6 Normal Distribution

Histograms and density plots provide excellent summaries of a distribution. But can we summarize even further? We often see the average and standard deviation used as summary statistics: a two-number summary! To understand what these summaries are and why they are so widely used, we need to understand the normal distribution. 

The normal distribution, also known as the bell curve and as the Gaussian distribution, is one of the most famous mathematical concepts in history. A reason for this is that approximately normal distributions occur in many situations, including gambling winnings, heights, weights, blood pressure, standardized test scores, and experimental measurement errors. There are explanations for this, but we describe these later. Here we focus on how the normal distribution helps us summarize data. 

Rather than using data, the normal distribution is defined with a mathematical formula. For any interval $(a,b)$, the proportion of values in that interval can be computed using this formula:

$$\mbox{Pr}(a < x < b) = \int_a^b \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}s} e^{-\frac{1}{2}\left( \frac{x-m}{s} \right)^2} \, dx$$

You don't need to memorize or understand the details of the formula. But note that it is completely defined by just two parameters: $m$ and $s$. The rest of the symbols in the formula represent the interval ends that we determine, $a$ and $b$, and known mathematical constants $\pi$ and $e$. These two parameters, $m$ and $s$, are referred to as the _average_ (also called the _mean_) and the _standard deviation_ (SD) of the distribution, respectively. 

The distribution is symmetric, centered at the average, and most values (about 95%) are within 2 SDs from the average. Here is what the normal distribution looks like when the average is 0 and the SD is 1:

<center>

```{r normal-distribution-density, echo=FALSE}
mu <- 0; s <- 1
norm_dist <- data.frame(x=seq(-4,4,len=50)*s+mu) %>% mutate(density=dnorm(x,mu,s))
norm_dist %>% ggplot(aes(x,density)) + geom_line()
```

</center>

The fact that the distribution is defined by just two parameters implies that if a dataset is approximated by a normal distribution, all the information needed to describe the distribution can be encoded in just two numbers: the average and the standard deviation. We now define these values for an arbitrary list of numbers.

For a list of numbers contained in a vector `x`, the average is defined as: 

```{r, eval=TRUE}
m <- sum(x) / length(x)
```

and the SD is defined as:
```{r}
s <- sqrt(sum((x-mu)^2) / length(x))
```
which can be interpreted as the average distance between values and their average. 

Let's compute the values for the height for males which we will store in the object $x$:

```{r}
index <- heights$sex == "Male"
x <- heights$height[index]
```

The pre-built functions `mean` and `sd` (note that for reasons explained in Section \@ref(data-driven-model), `sd` divides by `length(x)-1` rather than `length(x)`) can be used here:
```{r}
m <- mean(x)
s <- sd(x)
c(average = m, sd = s)
```

Here is a plot of the smooth density and the normal distribution with mean  = `r round(m,1)` and SD = `r round(s,1)` plotted as a black line with our student height smooth density in blue:

<center>

```{r data-and-normal-densities, echo=FALSE}
norm_dist <- data.frame(x = seq(-4, 4, len=50)*s + m) %>% 
  mutate(density = dnorm(x, m, s))

heights %>% filter(sex == "Male") %>% ggplot(aes(height)) +
  geom_density(fill="#0099FF") +
  geom_line(aes(x, density),  data = norm_dist, lwd=1.5) 
```

</center>

The normal distribution does appear to be quite a good approximation here. We now will see how well this approximation works at predicting the proportion of values within intervals.

### 1.2.7 Normal Distribution: Standard Units and Z-scores

### Standard units

For data that are approximately normal, *standard units* describe the number of standard deviations an observation is from the mean. Standard units are denoted by the variable 𝑧 and are also known as *z-scores*.

For any value 𝑥 from a normal distribution with mean 𝜇 and standard deviation 𝜎, the value in standard units is:

$$𝑧= \frac{x-𝜇}{𝜎}$$
Standard units are useful for many reasons. Note that the formula for the normal distribution is simplified by substituting 𝑧 in the exponent:


$$\mbox{Pr}(a < x < b) = \int_a^b \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi𝜎}} e^{-\frac{1}{2}z^2} \, dx$$

When 𝑧 = 0, the normal distribution is at a maximum, the mean 𝜇. The function is defined to be symmetric around 𝑧 = 0.

The normal distribution of z-scores is called the *standard normal distribution* and is defined by 𝜇 = 0 and 𝜎 = 1.

Z-scores are useful to quickly evaluate whether an observation is average or extreme. Z-scores near 0 are average. Z-scores above 2 or below -2 are significantly above or below the mean, and z-scores above 3 or below -3 are extremely rare. 

We will learn more about benchmark z-score values and their corresponding probabilities below.

### Code: Converting to standard units

The `scale` function converts a vector of approximately normally distributed values into z-scores.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
z <- scale(x)
```

You can compute the proportion of observations that are within 2 standard deviations of the mean like this:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
mean(abs(z) < 2)
```

### The 68-95-99.7 Rule

The normal distribution is associated with the 68-95-99.7 rule. This rule describes the probability of observing events within a certain number of standard deviations of the mean. 

<center>
   
<figure>
<img src="./images/pic4.png" alt="R Studio" style="width:500px">
</figure> 
  
</center>

The probability distribution function for the normal distribution is defined such that:

- About 68% of observations will be within one standard deviation of the mean (𝜇±𝜎). In standard units, this is equivalent to a z-score of ∣𝑧∣≤1.

<center>
   
<figure>
<img src="./images/pic5.png" alt="R Studio" style="width:500px">
</figure> 
  
</center>

- About 95% of observations will be within two standard deviations of the mean (𝜇±2𝜎). In standard units, this is equivalent to a z-score of ∣𝑧∣≤2.

<center>
   
<figure>
<img src="./images/pic6.png" alt="R Studio" style="width:500px">
</figure> 
  
</center>

- About 99.7% of observations will be within three standard deviations of the mean (𝜇±3𝜎). In standard units, this is equivalent to a z-score of ∣𝑧∣≤3.

<center>
   
<figure>
<img src="./images/pic7.png" alt="R Studio" style="width:500px">
</figure> 
  
</center>

- We will learn how to compute these exact probabilities in a later section, as well as probabilities for other intervals.

### Theoretical continuous distributions

In the Data Visualization Module we introduced the normal distribution as a useful approximation to many naturally occurring distributions, including that of height. The cumulative distribution for the normal distribution is defined by a mathematical formula which in R can be obtained with the function `pnorm`. We say that a random quantity is normally distributed with average `m` and standard deviation `s` if its probability distribution is defined by:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
F(a) = pnorm(a, m, s)
```

This is useful because if we are willing to use the normal approximation for, say, height, we don't need the entire dataset to answer questions such as: what is the probability that a randomly selected student is taller then 70 inches? We just need the average height and standard deviation:

```{r}
m <- mean(x)
s <- sd(x)
1 - pnorm(70.5, m, s)
```

### Theoretical distributions as approximations

The normal distribution is derived mathematically: we do not need data to define it. For practicing data scientists, almost everything we do involves data. Data is always, technically speaking, discrete. For example, we could consider our height data categorical with each specific height a unique category. The probability distribution is defined by the proportion of students reporting each height. Here is a plot of that probability distribution:

<center>

```{r plot-of-height-frequencies, echo=FALSE}
rafalib::mypar()
plot(prop.table(table(x)), xlab = "a = Height in inches", ylab = "Pr(X = a)")
```

</center>

While most students rounded up their heights to the nearest inch, others reported values with more precision. One student reported his height to be 69.6850393700787, which is 177 centimeters. The probability assigned to this height is `r 1/length(x)` or 1 in `r length(x)`. The probability for 70 inches is much higher at `r mean(x==70)`, but does it really make sense to think of the probability of being exactly 70 inches as being different than 69.6850393700787? Clearly it is much more useful for data analytic purposes to treat this outcome as a continuous numeric variable, keeping in mind that very few people, or perhaps none, are exactly 70 inches, and that the reason we get more values at 70 is because people round to the nearest inch. 

With continuous distributions, the probability of a singular value is not even defined. For example, it does not make sense to ask what is the probability that a normally distributed value is 70. Instead, we define probabilities for intervals. We thus could ask what is the probability that someone is between 69.5 and 70.5.

In cases like height, in which the data is rounded, the normal approximation is particularly useful if we deal with intervals that include exactly one round number. For example, the normal distribution is useful for approximating the proportion of students reporting values in intervals like the following three:

```{r}
mean(x <= 68.5) - mean(x <= 67.5)
mean(x <= 69.5) - mean(x <= 68.5)
mean(x <= 70.5) - mean(x <= 69.5)
```

Note how close we get with the normal approximation:

```{r}
pnorm(68.5, m, s) - pnorm(67.5, m, s) 
pnorm(69.5, m, s) - pnorm(68.5, m, s) 
pnorm(70.5, m, s) - pnorm(69.5, m, s) 
```

However, the approximation is not as useful for other intervals. For instance, notice how the approximation breaks down when we try to estimate:

```{r}
mean(x <= 70.9) - mean(x<=70.1)
```

with

```{r}
pnorm(70.9, m, s) - pnorm(70.1, m, s)
```

In general, we call this situation _discretization_. Although the true height distribution is continuous, the reported heights tend to be more common at discrete values, in this case, due to rounding. As long as we are aware of how to deal with this reality, the normal approximation can still be a very useful tool.

### 1.3.1 Definition of quantiles

*Quantiles* are cutoff points that divide a dataset into intervals with set probabilities. The 𝑞th quantile is the value at which 𝑞% of the observations are equal to or less than that value.

#### Using the **quantile** function

Given a dataset data and desired quantile `q`, you can find the `q`th quantile of `data` with:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
quantile(data,q)
```

#### Percentiles

*Percentiles* are the quantiles that divide a dataset into 100 intervals each with 1% probability. You can determine all percentiles of a dataset `data` like this:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
p <- seq(0.01, 0.99, 0.01)
quantile(data, p)
```

### Quartiles

*Quartiles* divide a dataset into 4 parts each with 25% probability. They are equal to the 25th, 50th and 75th percentiles. The 25th percentile is also known as the *1st quartile*, the 50th percentile is also known as the *median*, and the 75th percentile is also known as the *3rd quartile*.

The `summary()` function returns the minimum, quartiles and maximum of a vector.

#### Examples

Load the heights dataset from the **dslabs** package:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(dslabs)
data(heights)
```

Use `summary()` on the heights$height variable to find the quartiles:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
summary(heights$height)
```

Find the percentiles of heights$height:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
p <- seq(0.01, 0.99, 0.01)
percentiles <- quantile(heights$height, p)
```

Confirm that the 25th and 75th percentiles match the 1st and 3rd quartiles. Note that `quantile()` returns a named vector. You can access the 25th and 75th percentiles like this (adapt the code for other percentile values):

```{r, eval = FALSE}
percentiles[names(percentiles) == "25%"]
percentiles[names(percentiles) == "75%"]
```

---

### 1.3.2 Finding quantiles with qnorm

#### Definition of qnorm

The `qnorm()` function gives the theoretical value of a quantile with probability `p` of observing a value equal to or less than that quantile value given a normal distribution with mean `mu` and standard deviation `sigma`:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
qnorm(p, mu, sigma)
```

By default, `mu=0` and `sigma=1`. Therefore, calling `qnorm()` with no arguments gives quantiles for the standard normal distribution.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
qnorm(p)
```

Recall that quantiles are defined such that `p` is the probability of a random observation less than or equal to the quantile.

#### Relation to pnorm

The `pnorm()` function gives the probability that a value from a standard normal distribution will be less than or equal to a z-score value z. Consider:

`pnorm(-1.96)` ≈ 0.025

The result of `pnorm()` is the quantile. Note that:

`qnorm(0.025)` ≈ −1.96

`qnorm()` and `pnorm()` are inverse functions:

`pnorm(qnorm(0.025))` = 0.025

#### Theoretical quantiles

You can use `qnorm()` to determine the *theoretical quantiles* of a dataset: that is, the theoretical value of quantiles assuming that a dataset follows a normal distribution. Run the `qnorm()` function with the desired probabilities p, mean mu and standard deviation sigma. 

Suppose male heights follow a normal distribution with a mean of 69 inches and standard deviation of 3 inches. The theoretical quantiles are:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
p <- seq(0.01, 0.99, 0.01)
theoretical_quantiles <- qnorm(p, 69, 3)
```

Theoretical quantiles can be compared to sample quantiles determined with the quantile function in order to evaluate whether the sample follows a normal distribution.

A systematic way to assess how well the normal distribution fits the data is to check if the observed and predicted proportions match. In general, this is the approach of the quantile-quantile plot (QQ-plot).

First let's define the theoretical quantiles for the normal distribution. In statistics books we use the symbol $\Phi(x)$ to define the function that gives us the probability of a standard normal distribution being smaller than $x$. So, for example, $\Phi(-1.96) = 0.025$ and $\Phi(1.96) = 0.975$. In R, we can evaluate $\Phi$ using the `pnorm` function:

```{r}
pnorm(-1.96)
```


The inverse function $\Phi^{-1}(x)$ gives us the _theoretical quantiles_ for the normal distribution. So, for example, $\Phi^{-1}(0.975) = 1.96$. In R, we can evaluate the inverse of $\Phi$ using the `qnorm` function.

```{r}
qnorm(0.975)
```

Note that these calculations are for the standard normal distribution by default (mean = 0, standard deviation = 1), but we can also define these for any normal distribution. We can do this using the `mean` and `sd` arguments in the `pnorm` and `qnorm` function. For example, we can use `qnorm` to determine quantiles of a distribution with a specific average and standard deviation

```{r}
qnorm(0.975, mean = 5, sd = 2)
```

For the normal distribution, all the calculations related to quantiles are done without data, thus the name _theoretical quantiles_. But quantiles can be defined for any distribution, including an empirical one. So if we have data in a vector $x$, we can define the quantile associated with any proportion $p$ as the $q$ for which the proportion of values below $q$ is $p$. Using R code, we can define `q` as the value for which `mean(x <= q) = p`. Notice that not all $p$ have a $q$ for which the proportion is exactly $p$. There are several ways of defining the best $q$ as discussed in the help for the `quantile` function. 

To give a quick example, for the male heights data, we have that:
```{r}
mean(x <= 69.5)
```
So about 50% are shorter or equal to 69 inches. This implies that if $p=0.50$ then $q=69.5$.

The idea of a QQ-plot is that if your data is well approximated by normal distribution then the quantiles of your data should be similar to the quantiles of a normal distribution. To construct a QQ-plot, we do the following:

1. Define a vector of $m$ proportions $p_1, p_2, \dots, p_m$.
2. Define a vector of quantiles $q_1, \dots, q_m$ for your data for the proportions $p_1, \dots, p_m$. We refer to these as the _sample quantiles_. 
3. Define a vector of theoretical quantiles for the proportions $p_1, \dots, p_m$ for a normal distribution with the same average and standard deviation as the data.
4. Plot the sample quantiles versus the theoretical quantiles.


Let's construct a QQ-plot using R code. Start by defining the vector of proportions.
```{r}
p <- seq(0.05, 0.95, 0.05)
```

To obtain the quantiles from the data, we can use the `quantile` function like this:
```{r}
sample_quantiles <- quantile(x, p)
```

To obtain the theoretical normal distribution quantiles with the corresponding average and SD, we use the `qnorm` function:
```{r}
theoretical_quantiles <- qnorm(p, mean = mean(x), sd = sd(x))
```

To see if they match or not, we plot them against each other and draw the identity line:

<center>

```{r qqplot-original}
qplot(theoretical_quantiles, sample_quantiles) + geom_abline()
```

</center>

Notice that this code becomes much cleaner if we use standard units:
```{r qqplot-standardized, eval=FALSE}
sample_quantiles <- quantile(z, p)
theoretical_quantiles <- qnorm(p) 
qplot(theoretical_quantiles, sample_quantiles) + geom_abline()
```

The above code is included to help describe QQ-plots. However, in practice it is easier to use the **ggplot2** code described in Section \@ref(other-geometries): 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
heights %>% filter(sex == "Male") %>%
  ggplot(aes(sample = scale(height))) + 
  geom_qq() +
  geom_abline()
```

While for the illustration above we used 20 quantiles, the default from the `geom_qq` function is to use as many quantiles as data points.

### 1.3.4 Percentiles

<div class="infobox">
  
  **Textbook link** The contents are discussed within the [textbook section - 8.11 Percentiles](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/distributions.html#percentiles).
  
</div>

---

Before we move on, let's define some terms that are commonly used in exploratory data analysis.

_Percentiles_ are special cases of  _quantiles_ that are commonly used. The percentiles are the quantiles you obtain when setting the $p$ at $0.01, 0.02, ..., 0.99$. We call, for example, the case of $p=0.25$ the 25th percentile, which gives us a number for which 25% of the data is below. The most famous percentile is the 50th, also known as the _median_. 

For the normal distribution the _median_ and average are the same, but this is generally not the case.

Another special case that receives a name are the _quartiles_, which are obtained when setting $p=0.25,0.50$, and $0.75$.

### 1.3.5 Boxplots


<div class="infobox">
  
  **Textbook link** The contents are discussed within the [textbook section - 8.12 Boxplots](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/distributions.html#boxplots).

</div>

---

To introduce boxplots we will go back to the US murder data. 
Suppose we want to summarize the murder rate distribution. Using the data visualization technique we have learned, we can quickly see that the normal approximation does not apply here:

```{r hist-qqplot-non-normal-data, out.width = "100%",  fig.width = 6, fig.height = 3, echo=FALSE}
data(murders)
murders <- murders %>% mutate(rate = total/population*100000)
library(gridExtra)
p1 <- murders %>% ggplot(aes(x=rate)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 1) + ggtitle("Histogram")
p2 <- murders %>% ggplot(aes(sample=rate)) + 
  geom_qq(dparams=summarize(murders, mean=mean(rate), sd=sd(rate))) +
  geom_abline() + ggtitle("QQ-plot")
grid.arrange(p1, p2, ncol = 2)
```

In this case, the histogram above or a smooth density plot would serve as a relatively succinct summary. 

Now suppose those used to receiving just two numbers as summaries ask us for a more compact numerical summary.

Here Tukey offered some advice. Provide a five-number summary composed of the range along with the quartiles (the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles). Tukey further suggested that we ignore _outliers_ when computing the range and instead plot these as independent points. We provide a detailed explanation of outliers later. Finally, he suggested we plot these numbers as a "box" with "whiskers" like this:
 
<center>

```{r first-boxplot, echo=FALSE}
murders %>% ggplot(aes("",rate)) + geom_boxplot() +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0, 2)) + xlab("")
```

</center>

with the box defined by the 25% and 75% percentile and the whiskers showing the range. The distance between these two is called the _interquartile_ range. The two points are outliers according to Tukey's definition. The median is shown with a horizontal line. Today, we call these _boxplots_. 

From just this simple plot, we know that the median is about 2.5, that the distribution is not symmetric, and that the range is 0 to 5 for the great majority of states with two exceptions.

We discuss how to make boxplots in Section \@ref(other-geometries).

### 1.4.1 Stratification 

In data analysis we often divide observations into groups based on the values of one or more variables associated with those observations. For example in the next section we divide the height values into groups based on a sex variable: females and males. We call this procedure _stratification_ and refer to the resulting groups as _strata_. 

Stratification is common in data visualization because we are often interested in how the distribution of variables differs across different subgroups. We will see several examples throughout this part of the book. We will revisit the concept of stratification when we learn regression in Chapter \@ref(regression) and in the Machine Learning part of the book.

### 1.4 Distribution of Female Heights

<div class="infobox">

### Case study: describing student heights (continued)

Using the histogram, density plots, and QQ-plots, we have become convinced that the male height data is well approximated with a normal distribution. In this case, we report back to ET a very succinct summary: male heights follow a normal distribution with an average of `r round(m, 1)` inches and a SD of `r round(s,1)` inches. With this information, ET will have a good idea of what to expect when he meets our male students.
However, to provide a complete picture we need to also provide a summary of the female heights. 

We learned that boxplots are useful when we want to quickly compare two or more distributions. Here are the heights for men and women:

<center>

```{r female-male-boxplots, echo=FALSE}
heights %>% ggplot(aes(x=sex, y=height, fill=sex)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

</center>

The plot immediately reveals that males are, on average, taller than females. The standard deviations appear to be similar. But does the normal approximation also work for the female height data collected by the survey? We expect that they will follow a normal distribution, just like males. However, exploratory plots reveal that the approximation is not as useful:
 

```{r histogram-qqplot-female-heights, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%",  fig.width = 6, fig.height = 3}
p1 <- heights %>% filter(sex == "Female") %>%
  ggplot(aes(height)) +
  geom_density(fill="#F8766D") 
p2 <- heights %>% filter(sex == "Female") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(sample=scale(height))) +
  geom_qq() + geom_abline() + ylab("Standard Units")
grid.arrange(p1, p2, ncol=2)
```

We see something we did not see for the males: the density plot has a second "bump". Also, the QQ-plot shows that the highest points tend to be taller than expected by the normal distribution. Finally,  we also see five points in the QQ-plot that suggest shorter than expected heights for a normal distribution. When reporting back to ET, we might need to provide a histogram rather than just the average and standard deviation for the female heights. 

However, go back and read Tukey's quote. We have noticed what we didn't expect to see. If we look at other female height distributions, we do find that they are well approximated with a normal distribution. So why are our female students different? Is our class a requirement for the female basketball team? Are small proportions of females claiming to be taller than they are? Another, perhaps more likely, explanation is that in the form students used to enter their heights, `FEMALE` was the default sex and some males entered their heights, but forgot to change the sex variable. In any case, data visualization has helped discover a potential flaw in our data. 

Regarding the five smallest values, note that these values are:
```{r}
heights %>% filter(sex == "Female") %>% 
  top_n(5, desc(height)) %>%
  pull(height)
```

Because these are reported heights, a possibility is that the student meant to enter `5'1"`, `5'2"`, `5'3"` or `5'5"`.

## Section 2: Introduction to ggplot2

In Section 2, you will learn how to create data visualizations in `r rproj()` using the **ggplot2** package.

After completing Section 2, you will:

- be able to use **ggplot2** to create data visualizations in `r rproj()`.
- be able to explain what the data component of a graph is.
- be able to identify the geometry component of a graph and know when to use which type of geometry.
- be able to explain what the aesthetic mapping component of a graph is.
- be able to understand the scale component of a graph and select an appropriate scale component to use.

There is 1 assignment that uses the DataCamp platform for you to practice your coding skills.

Note that it can be hard to memorize all of the functions and arguments used by **ggplot2**, so we recommend that you have a [cheat sheet](https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ggplot2-cheatsheet.pdf) handy to help you remember the necessary commands.

We encourage you to use `r rproj()` to interactively test out your answers and further your learning.

### 2.1.1 ggplot2

Exploratory data visualization is perhaps the greatest strength of R. One can quickly go from idea to data to plot with a unique balance of flexibility and ease. For example, Excel may be easier than R for some plots, but it is nowhere near as flexible. D3.js may be more flexible and powerful than R, but it takes much longer to generate a plot.

Throughout the book, we will be creating plots using the [__ggplot2__](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) package. 

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
```

Many other approaches are available for creating plots in R. In fact, the plotting capabilities that come with a basic installation of R are already quite powerful. There are also other packages for creating graphics such as __grid__ and __lattice__. We chose to use __ggplot2__ in this book because it breaks plots into components in a way that permits beginners to create relatively complex and aesthetically pleasing plots using syntax that is intuitive and comparatively easy to remember. 

One reason __ggplot2__ is generally more intuitive for beginners is that it uses a [grammar of graphics](http://www.springer.com/us/book/9780387245447), the _gg_ in __ggplot2__. This is analogous to the way learning grammar can help a beginner construct hundreds of different sentences by learning just a handful of verbs, nouns and adjectives without having to memorize each specific sentence. Similarly, by learning a handful of __ggplot2__ building blocks and its grammar, you will be able to create hundreds of different plots. 

Another reason __ggplot2__ is easy for beginners is that its default behavior is carefully chosen to satisfy the great majority of cases and is visually pleasing. As a result, it is possible to create informative and elegant graphs with relatively simple and readable code.

One limitation is that __ggplot2__ is designed to work exclusively with data tables in tidy format (where rows are observations and columns are variables). However, a substantial percentage of datasets that beginners work with are in, or can be converted into, this format. An advantage of this approach is that, assuming that our data is tidy, __ggplot2__ simplifies plotting code and the learning of grammar for a variety of plots. 

To use __ggplot2__  you will have to learn several functions and arguments. These are hard to memorize, so we highly recommend you have the ggplot2 cheat sheet  handy. You can get a copy here: [https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ggplot2-cheatsheet.pdf](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ggplot2-cheatsheet.pdf) or simply perform an internet search for "ggplot2 cheat sheet".

### 2.1.2 Graph Components

We will construct a graph that summarizes the US murders dataset that looks like this:

<center>

```{r ggplot-example-plot, echo=FALSE}
library(dslabs)
data(murders)
library(ggthemes)
library(ggrepel)

r <- murders %>% 
  summarize(pop=sum(population), tot=sum(total)) %>% 
  mutate(rate = tot/pop*10^6) %>% pull(rate)

murders %>% ggplot(aes(x = population/10^6, y = total, label = abb)) +  
  geom_abline(intercept = log10(r), lty=2, col="darkgrey") +
  geom_point(aes(color=region), size = 3) +
  geom_text_repel() + 
  scale_x_log10() +
  scale_y_log10() +
  xlab("Populations in millions (log scale)") + 
  ylab("Total number of murders (log scale)") +
  ggtitle("US Gun Murders in 2010") +
  scale_color_discrete(name="Region") +
  theme_economist()
```

</center>

We can clearly see how much states vary across population size and the total number of murders. Not surprisingly, we also see a clear relationship between murder totals and population size. A state falling on the dashed grey line has the same murder rate as the US average. The four geographic regions are denoted with color, which depicts how most southern states have murder rates above the average. 

This data visualization shows us pretty much all the information in the data table. The code needed to make this plot is relatively simple. We will learn to create the plot part by part. 

The first step in learning __ggplot2__ is to be able to break a graph apart into components. Let's break down the plot above and introduce some of the __ggplot2__ terminology. The main three components to note are:
 
* __Data__: The US murders data table is being summarized. We refer to this as the __data__ component. 
*  __Geometry__: The plot above is a scatterplot. This is referred to as the 
__geometry__ component. Other possible geometries are barplot, histogram, smooth densities, qqplot, and boxplot. We will learn more about these in the Data Visualization part of the book.
* __Aesthetic mapping__: The plot uses several visual cues to represent the information provided by the dataset. The two most important cues in this plot are the point positions on the x-axis and y-axis, which represent population size and the total number of murders, respectively. Each point represents a different observation, and we _map_ data about these observations to visual cues like x- and y-scale. Color is another visual cue that we map to region. We refer to this as the __aesthetic mapping__ component. How we define the mapping depends on what __geometry__ we are using. 

We also note that:

* The points are labeled with the state abbreviations.
* The range of the x-axis and y-axis appears to be defined by the range of the data. They are both on log-scales. 
* There are labels, a title, a legend, and we use the style of The Economist magazine.

We will now construct the plot piece by piece.

We start by loading the dataset:

```{r}
library(dslabs)
data(murders)
```

---

### 2.1.3 Creating a New Plot

```{r, echo=FALSE}
theme_set(theme_grey()) ## to immitate what happens with setting theme
```

The first step in creating a __ggplot2__ graph is to define a `ggplot` object. We do this with the function `ggplot`, which initializes the graph. If we read the help file for this function, we see that the first argument is used to specify what data is associated with this object: 


```{r ggplot-example-1, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = murders)
```

We can also pipe the data in as the first argument. So this line of code is equivalent to the one above:

```{r ggplot-example-2}
murders %>% ggplot()
```

It renders a plot, in this case a blank slate since no geometry has been defined. The only style choice we see is a grey background.

What has happened above is that the object was created and, because it was not assigned, it was automatically evaluated. But we can assign our plot to an object, for example like this:

```{r}
p <- ggplot(data = murders)
class(p)
```

To render the plot associated with this object, we simply print the object `p`. The following two lines of code each produce the same plot we see above:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
print(p)
p
```

### 2.2.1 Layers

<div class="infobox">
  
  **Textbook link** The contents are discussed within the [textbook section - 7.3 Geometries](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/ggplot2.html#geometries), [textbook section - 7.4 Aesthetic mappings](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/ggplot2.html#aesthetic-mappings), and [textbook section - 7.5 Layers](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/ggplot2.html#layers).  
  
</div>

---

In `ggplot2` we create graphs by adding _layers_. Layers can define geometries, compute summary statistics, define what scales to use, or even change styles.
To add layers, we use the symbol `+`. In general, a line of code will look like this:

>> DATA %>% `ggplot()` + LAYER 1 + LAYER 2 + ... + LAYER N

Usually, the first added layer defines the geometry. We want to make a scatterplot. What geometry do we use?

Taking a quick look at the cheat sheet, we see that the function used to create plots with this geometry is `geom_point`.

<!--(Source: [RStudio](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/data-visualization-2.1.pdf))-->


Geometry function names follow the pattern: `geom_X` where X is the name of the geometry. Some examples include `geom_point`, `geom_bar`, and `geom_histogram`.

For `geom_point` to run properly we need to provide data and a mapping. We have already connected the object `p` with the `murders` data table, and if we add the layer `geom_point` it defaults to using this data. To find out what mappings are expected, we read the __Aesthetics__ section of the help file `geom_point` help file:

```
> Aesthetics
> 
> geom_point understands the following aesthetics (required aesthetics are in bold):
>
> x
>
> y
> 
> alpha
>
> colour
```

and, as expected, we see that at least two arguments are required `x` and `y`. 
 
--- 
### Aesthetic mappings
 
  __Aesthetic mappings__ describe how properties of the data connect with features of the graph, such as distance along an axis, size, or color. The `aes` function connects data with what we see on the graph by defining aesthetic mappings and will be one of the functions you use most often when plotting. The outcome of the `aes` function is often used as the argument of a geometry function. This example produces a scatterplot of total murders versus population in millions:
 
```{r, eval = FALSE}
murders %>% ggplot() + 
  geom_point(aes(x = population/10^6, y = total))
```
 
We can drop the `x = ` and `y =` if we wanted to since these are the first and second expected arguments, as seen in the help page. 

Instead of defining our plot from scratch, we can also add a layer to the `p` object that was defined above as `p <- ggplot(data = murders)`:

```{r ggplot-example-3}
p + geom_point(aes(population/10^6, total))
```


The scale and labels are defined by default when adding this layer. Like  __dplyr__ functions, `aes` also uses the variable names from the object component: we can use `population` and `total` without having to call them as `murders$population` and `murders$total`. The behavior of recognizing the variables from the data component is quite specific to `aes`. With most functions, if you try to access the values of `population` or `total` outside of `aes` you receive an error. 

---

### Layers

A second layer in the plot we wish to make involves adding a label to each point to identify the state. The `geom_label` and `geom_text` functions permit us to add text to the plot with and without a rectangle behind the text, respectively.

Because each point (each state in this case) has a label, we need an aesthetic mapping to make the connection between points and labels. By reading the help file, we learn that we supply the mapping between point and label through the `label` argument of `aes`.  So the code looks like this:

```{r  ggplot-example-4}
p + geom_point(aes(population/10^6, total)) +
  geom_text(aes(population/10^6, total, label = abb))
```

We have successfully added a second layer to the plot. 

As an example of the unique behavior of `aes` mentioned above, note that this call: 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
p_test <- p + geom_text(aes(population/10^6, total, label = abb))
```

is fine, whereas this call:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
p_test <- p + geom_text(aes(population/10^6, total), label = abb) 
```

will give you an error since `abb` is not found because it is outside of the `aes` function. The layer `geom_text` does not know where to find `abb` since it is a column name and not a global variable.

---

### 2.2.2 Tinkering

<div class="infobox">
  
  **Textbook link** The contents are discussed within the [textbook section - 7.5.1 Tinkering with arguments](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/ggplot2.html#tinkering-with-arguments) and [textbook section - 7.6 Global versus local aesthetic mappings](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/ggplot2.html#global-versus-local-aesthetic-mappings).
  
</div>

---


Each geometry function has many arguments other than `aes` and `data`. They tend to be specific to the function. For example, in the plot we wish to make, the points are larger than the default size. In the help file we see that `size` is an aesthetic and we can change it like this:


```{r ggplot-example-5}
p + geom_point(aes(population/10^6, total), size = 3) +
  geom_text(aes(population/10^6, total, label = abb))
```

`size` is __not__ a mapping: whereas mappings use data from specific observations and need to be inside `aes()`, operations we want to affect all the points the same way do not need to be included inside `aes`.

Now because the points are larger it is hard to see the labels. If we read the help file for `geom_text`, we see the `nudge_x` argument, which moves the text slightly to the right or to the left:

```{r ggplot-example-6}
p + geom_point(aes(population/10^6, total), size = 3) +
  geom_text(aes(population/10^6, total, label = abb), nudge_x = 1.5)
```

This is preferred as it makes it easier to read the text. In Section \@ref(add-on-packages) we learn a better way of assuring we can see the points and the labels.

---

### Global versus local aesthetic mappings

In the previous line of code, we define the mapping `aes(population/10^6, total)` twice, once in each geometry. We can avoid this by using a _global_ aesthetic mapping. We can do this when we define the blank slate `ggplot` object. Remember that the function `ggplot` contains an argument that permits us to define aesthetic mappings:

```{r}
args(ggplot)
```

If we define a mapping in `ggplot`, all the geometries that are added as layers will default to this mapping. We redefine `p`:

```{r}
p <- murders %>% ggplot(aes(population/10^6, total, label = abb))
```

and then we can simply write the following code to produce the previous plot:

```{r ggplot-example-7, eval=FALSE}
p + geom_point(size = 3) + 
  geom_text(nudge_x = 1.5)
```

We keep the `size` and `nudge_x` arguments in `geom_point` and `geom_text`, respectively, because we want to only increase the size of points and only nudge the labels. If we put those arguments in `aes` then they would apply to both plots. Also note that the `geom_point` function does not need a `label` argument and therefore ignores that aesthetic.

If necessary, we can override the global mapping by defining a new mapping within each layer. These _local_ definitions override the _global_. Here is an example:


```{r ggplot-example-8}
p + geom_point(size = 3) +  
  geom_text(aes(x = 10, y = 800, label = "Hello there!"))
```

Clearly, the second call to `geom_text` does not use `population` and `total`.

---

### 2.2.3 Scales, Labels, and Colors

  **Textbook link** The contents are discussed within the [textbook section - 7.7 Scales](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/ggplot2.html#scales), [textbook section - 7.8 Labels and titles](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/ggplot2.html#labels-and-titles), [textbook section - 7.9 Categories as colors](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/ggplot2.html#categories-as-colors), and [textbook section - 7.10 Annotation, shapes, and adjustments](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/ggplot2.html#annotation-shapes-and-adjustments)
  
</div>

---

### Scales

First, our desired scales are in log-scale. This is not the default, so this change needs to be added through a _scales_ layer. A quick look at the cheat sheet reveals the `scale_x_continuous` function lets us control the behavior of scales. We use them like this: 

```{r ggplot-example-9}
p + geom_point(size = 3) +  
  geom_text(nudge_x = 0.05) + 
  scale_x_continuous(trans = "log10") +
  scale_y_continuous(trans = "log10") 
```

Because we are in the log-scale now, the _nudge_ must be made smaller.

This particular transformation is so common that __ggplot2__ provides the specialized functions `scale_x_log10` and `scale_y_log10`, which we can use to rewrite the code like this:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
p + geom_point(size = 3) +  
  geom_text(nudge_x = 0.05) + 
  scale_x_log10() +
  scale_y_log10() 
```

---

### Labels and titles

Similarly, the cheat sheet quickly reveals that to change labels and add a title, we use the following functions:

```{r ggplot-example-10}
p + geom_point(size = 3) +  
  geom_text(nudge_x = 0.05) + 
  scale_x_log10() +
  scale_y_log10() +
  xlab("Populations in millions (log scale)") + 
  ylab("Total number of murders (log scale)") +
  ggtitle("US Gun Murders in 2010")
```

We are almost there! All we have left to do is add color, a legend, and optional changes to the style.

---

### Categories as colors

We can change the color of the points using the `col` argument in the `geom_point` function. To facilitate demonstration of new features, we will redefine `p` to be everything except the points layer:

```{r}
p <-  murders %>% ggplot(aes(population/10^6, total, label = abb)) +   
  geom_text(nudge_x = 0.05) + 
  scale_x_log10() +
  scale_y_log10() +
  xlab("Populations in millions (log scale)") + 
  ylab("Total number of murders (log scale)") +
  ggtitle("US Gun Murders in 2010")
```

and then test out what happens by adding different calls to `geom_point`. We can make all the points blue by adding the `color` argument:

```{r ggplot-example-11}
p + geom_point(size = 3, color ="blue")
```

This, of course, is not what we want. We want to assign color depending on the geographical region. A nice default behavior of __ggplot2__ is that if we assign a categorical variable to color, it automatically assigns a different color to each category and also adds a legend.

Since the choice of color is determined by a feature of each observation, this is an aesthetic mapping. To map each point to a color, we need to use `aes`. We use the following code:

```{r ggplot-example-12}
p + geom_point(aes(col=region), size = 3)
```

The `x` and `y` mappings are inherited from those already defined in `p`, so we do not redefine them. We also move `aes` to the first argument since that is where mappings are expected in this function call.

Here we see yet another useful default behavior: __ggplot2__ automatically adds a legend that maps color to region. To avoid adding this legend we set the `geom_point` argument `show.legend = FALSE`. 

---

### Annotation, shapes, and adjustments

We often want to add shapes or annotation to figures that are not derived directly from the aesthetic mapping; examples include labels, boxes, shaded areas, and lines.

Here we want to add a line that represents the average murder rate for the entire country. Once we determine the per million rate to be $r$, this line is defined by the formula: $y = r x$, with $y$ and $x$ our axes: total murders and population in millions, respectively. In the log-scale this line turns into: $\log(y) = \log(r) + \log(x)$. So in our plot it's a line with slope 1 and intercept $\log(r)$. To compute this value, we use our __dplyr__ skills:

```{r}
r <- murders %>% 
  summarize(rate = sum(total) /  sum(population) * 10^6) %>% 
  pull(rate)
```

To add a line we use the `geom_abline` function. __ggplot2__ uses `ab` in the name to remind us we are supplying the intercept (`a`) and slope (`b`). The default line has slope 1 and intercept 0 so we only have to define the intercept:

```{r ggplot-example-13}
p + geom_point(aes(col=region), size = 3) + 
  geom_abline(intercept = log10(r))
```

Here `geom_abline` does not use any information from the data object.

We can change the line type and color of the lines using arguments. Also, we draw it first so it doesn't go over our points. 

```{r}
p <- p + geom_abline(intercept = log10(r), lty = 2, color = "darkgrey") +
  geom_point(aes(col=region), size = 3)  
```
Note that we have redefined `p` and used this new `p` below and in the next section.

The default plots created by __ggplot2__ are already very useful. However, we frequently need to make minor tweaks to the default behavior. Although it is not always obvious how to make these even with the cheat sheet, __ggplot2__ is very flexible.

For example, we can make changes to the legend via the `scale_color_discrete` function. In our plot the word _region_ is capitalized and we can change it like this:

```{r}
p <- p + scale_color_discrete(name = "Region") 
```

### 2.2.4 Add-on Packages

<div class="infobox">
  
  **Textbook link** The contents are discussed within the [textbook section - 7.11 Add-on packages](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/ggplot2.html#add-on-packages) and [textbook section - 7.12 Putting it all together](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/ggplot2.html#putting-it-all-together).
  
</div>

---

The power of __ggplot2__ is augmented further due to the availability of add-on packages.
The remaining changes needed to put the finishing touches on our plot require the __ggthemes__ and __ggrepel__ packages.

The style of a __ggplot2__ graph can be changed using the `theme` functions. Several themes are included as part of the __ggplot2__ package. In fact, for most of the plots in this book, we use a function in the __dslabs__ package that automatically sets a default theme:

```{r, eval}
ds_theme_set()
```

Many other themes are added by the package __ggthemes__. Among those are the `theme_economist` theme that we used. After installing the package, you can change the style by adding a layer like this:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(ggthemes)
p + theme_economist()
```

You can see how some of the other themes look by simply changing the function. For instance, you might try the `theme_fivethirtyeight()` theme instead.

The final difference has to do with the position of the labels. In our plot, some of the labels fall on top of each other. The add-on package __ggrepel__ includes a geometry that adds labels while ensuring that they don't fall on top of each other. We simply change `geom_text` with `geom_text_repel`.

--- 

### 2.2.5 Putting it all together

Now that we are done testing, we can write one piece of code that produces our desired plot from scratch. 


```{r final-ggplot-example}
library(ggthemes)
library(ggrepel)

r <- murders %>% 
  summarize(rate = sum(total) /  sum(population) * 10^6) %>%
  pull(rate)

murders %>% ggplot(aes(population/10^6, total, label = abb)) +   
  geom_abline(intercept = log10(r), lty = 2, color = "darkgrey") +
  geom_point(aes(col=region), size = 3) +
  geom_text_repel() + 
  scale_x_log10() +
  scale_y_log10() +
  xlab("Populations in millions (log scale)") + 
  ylab("Total number of murders (log scale)") +
  ggtitle("US Gun Murders in 2010") + 
  scale_color_discrete(name = "Region") +
  theme_economist()
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
ds_theme_set()
```

### 2.2.6 Other Examples

<div class="infobox">
  
  **Textbook link** The contents are discussed within the [textbook section - 8.16.2 Histograms](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/distributions.html#histograms-1), [textbook section - 8.16.3 Density plots](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/distributions.html#density-plots), [textbook section - 8.16.5 QQ-plots](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/distributions.html#qq-plots), and [textbook section - 7.14 Grids of plots](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/ggplot2.html#grids-of-plots).
  
</div>

---

### Histograms 

To generate histograms we use `geom_histogram`. By looking at the help file for this function, we learn that the only required argument is `x`, the variable for which we will construct a histogram. We dropped the `x` because we know it is the first argument.
The code looks like this:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
heights %>% 
  filter(sex == "Female") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(height)) + 
  geom_histogram()
```

If we run the code above, it gives us a message:

> `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with
`binwidth`.
 
We previously used a bin size of 1 inch, so the code looks like this:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
heights %>% 
  filter(sex == "Female") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(height)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1)
```

Finally, if for aesthetic reasons we want to add color, we use the arguments described in the help file. We also add labels and a title:

```{r height-histogram-geom}
heights %>% 
  filter(sex == "Female") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(height)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill = "blue", col = "black") +
  xlab("Male heights in inches") + 
  ggtitle("Histogram")
```

---

### Density plots

To create a smooth density, we use the `geom_density`. To make a smooth density plot with the data previously shown as a histogram we can use this code:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
heights %>% 
  filter(sex == "Female") %>%
  ggplot(aes(height)) +
  geom_density()
```

To fill in with color, we can use the `fill` argument.

```{r ggplot-density}
heights %>% 
  filter(sex == "Female") %>%
  ggplot(aes(height)) +
  geom_density(fill="blue")
```

To change the smoothness of the density, we use the `adjust` argument to multiply the default value by that `adjust`. For example, if we want the bandwidth to be twice as big we use:

```{r eval = FALSE}
heights %>% 
  filter(sex == "Female") + 
  geom_density(fill="blue", adjust = 2)
```

---

### QQ-plots 

For qq-plots we use the `geom_qq` geometry. From the help file, we learn that we need to specify the `sample` (we will learn about samples in a later chapter). Here is the qqplot for men heights.

```{r ggplot-qq}
heights %>% filter(sex=="Male") %>%
  ggplot(aes(sample = height)) +
  geom_qq()
```

By default, the sample variable is compared to a normal distribution with average 0 and standard deviation 1. To change this, we use the `dparams` arguments based on the help file. Adding an identity line is as simple as assigning another layer. For straight lines, we use the `geom_abline` function. The default line is the identity line (slope = 1, intercept = 0).

```{r  ggplot-qq-dparams, eval=FALSE}
params <- heights %>% filter(sex=="Male") %>%
  summarize(mean = mean(height), sd = sd(height))

heights %>% filter(sex=="Male") %>%
  ggplot(aes(sample = height)) +
  geom_qq(dparams = params) +
  geom_abline()
```

Another option here is to scale the data first and then make a qqplot against the standard normal. 

```{r ggplot-qq-standard-units, eval=FALSE}
heights %>% 
  filter(sex=="Male") %>%
  ggplot(aes(sample = scale(height))) + 
  geom_qq() +
  geom_abline()
```

---

### Quick plots with 

We have learned the powerful approach to generating visualization with ggplot. However, there are instances in which all we want is to make a quick plot of, for example, a histogram of the values in a vector, a scatterplot of the values in two vectors, or a boxplot using categorical and numeric vectors. We demonstrated how to generate these plots with `hist`, `plot`, and `boxplot`. However, if we want to keep consistent with the ggplot style, we can use the function `qplot`.

If we have values in two vectors, say:

```{r}
data(murders)
x <- log10(murders$population)
y <- murders$total
```

and we want to make a scatterplot with ggplot, we would have to type something like:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
data.frame(x = x, y = y) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x, y)) +
  geom_point()
```

This seems like too much code for such a simple plot.
The `qplot` function sacrifices the flexibility provided by the `ggplot` approach, but allows us to generate a plot quickly. 

```{r qplot-example-0, eval = FALSE}
qplot(x, y)
```

--- 

### Grids of plots
There are often reasons to graph plots next to each other. The __gridExtra__ package permits us to do that:

```{r gridExtra-example, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.height=2.5, fig.width=5}
library(gridExtra)
p1 <- qplot(x)
p2 <- qplot(x,y)
grid.arrange(p1, p2, ncol = 2)
```

### Section 3: dplyr

<div class="infobox">
  
  **Textbook link** The contents are discussed within the [textbook section - 4.7 Summarizing data](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/tidyverse.html#summarizing-data).
  
</div>

---

### 3.1 **dplyr**

An important part of exploratory data analysis is summarizing data. The average and standard deviation are two examples of widely used summary statistics. More informative summaries can often be achieved by first splitting data into groups. In this section, we cover two new __dplyr__ verbs that make these computations easier: `summarize` and `group_by`. We learn to access resulting values using the `pull` function.  

```{r, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

### 3.1.1 `summarize` 

The `summarize` function in __dplyr__ provides a way to compute summary statistics with intuitive and readable code. We start with a simple example based on heights. The `heights` dataset includes  heights and sex reported by students in an in-class survey. 

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(dslabs)
data(heights)
```

The following code computes the average and standard deviation for females:

```{r}
s <- heights %>% 
  filter(sex == "Female") %>%
  summarize(average = mean(height), standard_deviation = sd(height))
s
```

This takes our original data table as input, filters it to keep only females, and then produces a new summarized table with just the average and the standard deviation of heights. We get to choose the names of the columns of the resulting table. For example, above we decided to use `average` and `standard_deviation`, but we could have used other names just the same.

Because the resulting table stored in `s` is a data frame, we can access the components with the accessor `$`:

```{r}
s$average
s$standard_deviation
```

As with most other __dplyr__ functions, `summarize` is aware of the variable names and we can use them directly. So when inside the call to the `summarize` function we write `mean(height)`, the function is accessing the column with the name "height" and then computing the average of the resulting numeric vector. We can compute any other summary that operates on vectors and returns a single value. For example, we can add the median, minimum, and maximum heights like this:

```{r}
heights %>% 
  filter(sex == "Female") %>%
  summarize(median = median(height), minimum = min(height), 
            maximum = max(height))
```

We can obtain these three values with just one line using the `quantile` function: for example, `quantile(x, c(0,0.5,1))` returns the min (0th percentile), median (50th percentile), and max (100th percentile) of the vector `x`. However, if we attempt to use a function like this that returns two or more values inside `summarize`:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
heights %>% 
  filter(sex == "Female") %>%
  summarize(range = quantile(height, c(0, 0.5, 1)))
```

we will receive an error: `Error: expecting result of length one, got : 2`. With the function `summarize`, we can only call functions that return a single value. In Section \@ref(do), we will learn how to deal with functions that return more than one value.

For another example of how we can use the `summarize` function, let's compute the average murder rate for the United States. Remember our data table includes total murders and population size for each state and we have already used __dplyr__ to add a murder rate column:

```{r}
murders <- murders %>% mutate(rate = total/population*100000)
```

Remember that the US murder rate is **not** the average of the state murder rates:

```{r}
summarize(murders, mean(rate))
```

This is because in the computation above the small states are given the same weight as the large ones. The US murder rate is the total number of murders in the US divided by the total US population. So the correct computation is:

```{r}
us_murder_rate <- murders %>%
  summarize(rate = sum(total) / sum(population) * 100000)
us_murder_rate
```

This computation counts larger states proportionally to their size which results in a larger value.


### `pull`

The `us_murder_rate` object defined above represents just one number. Yet we are storing it in a data frame:

```{r}
class(us_murder_rate)
```

since, as most __dplyr__ functions, `summarize` always returns a data frame.

This might be problematic if we want to use this result with functions that require a numeric value. Here we show a useful trick for accessing values stored in data when using pipes: when a data object is piped that object and its columns can be accessed using the `pull` function. To understand what we mean take a look at this line of code:

```{r}
us_murder_rate %>% pull(rate)
```

This returns the value in the `rate` column of `us_murder_rate` making it equivalent to `us_murder_rate$rate`. 

To get a number from the original data table with one line of code we can type:

```{r}
us_murder_rate <- murders %>% 
  summarize(rate = sum(total) / sum(population) * 100000) %>%
  pull(rate)

us_murder_rate
```

which is now a numeric:

```{r}
class(us_murder_rate)
```

---

### 3.1.2 The Dot Placeholder

<div class="infobox">
  
  **Textbook link** The contents are discussed within the [textbook section - 4.11 The dot operator](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/tidyverse.html#the-dot-operator).
  
</div>

---

One of the advantages of using the pipe `%>%` is that we do not have to keep naming new objects as we manipulate the data frame. As a quick reminder, if we want to compute the median murder rate for states in the southern states, instead of typing:

```{r}
tab_1 <- filter(murders, region == "South")
tab_2 <- mutate(tab_1, rate = total / population * 10^5)
rates <- tab_2$rate
median(rates)
```

We can avoid defining any new intermediate objects by instead typing:

```{r}
filter(murders, region == "South") %>% 
  mutate(rate = total / population * 10^5) %>% 
  summarize(median = median(rate)) %>%
  pull(median)
```

We can do this because each of these functions takes a data frame as the first argument. But what if we want to access a component of the data frame. For example, what if the `pull` function was not available and we wanted to access `tab_2$rate`? What data frame name would we use? The answer is the dot operator.

For example to access the rate vector without the `pull` function we could use

```{r}
rates <-   filter(murders, region == "South") %>% 
  mutate(rate = total / population * 10^5) %>% 
  .$rate
median(rates)
```

---

### 3.1.3 Group By

<div class="infobox">
  
  **Textbook link** The contents are discussed within the [textbook section - 4.7.3 Group then summarize with group_by](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/tidyverse.html#group-by).
  
</div>

---

A common operation in data exploration is to first split data into groups and then compute summaries for each group. For example, we may want to compute the average and standard deviation for men's and women's heights separately. The `group_by` function helps us do this. 

If we type this:

```{r}
heights %>% group_by(sex)
```

The result does not look very different from `heights`, except we see `Groups: sex [2]` when we print the object. Although not immediately obvious from its appearance, this is now a special data frame called a _grouped data frame_, and __dplyr__ functions, in particular `summarize`, will behave differently when acting on this object. Conceptually, you can think of this table as many tables, with the same columns but not necessarily the same number of rows, stacked together in one object. When we summarize the data after grouping, this is what happens:

```{r}
heights %>% 
  group_by(sex) %>%
  summarize(average = mean(height), standard_deviation = sd(height))
```

The `summarize` function applies the summarization to each group separately.

For another example, let's compute the median murder rate in the four regions of the country:

```{r}
murders %>% 
  group_by(region) %>%
  summarize(median_rate = median(rate))
```

---

### 3.1.4 Sorting Data Tables

<div class="infobox">
  
  **Textbook link** The contents are discussed within the [textbook section - 4.8 Sorting data frames](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/tidyverse.html#sorting-data-frames).

</div>

---

When examining a dataset, it is often convenient to sort the table by the different columns. We know about the `order` and `sort` function, but for ordering entire tables, the __dplyr__ function `arrange` is useful. For example, here we order the states by population size:

```{r}
murders %>%
  arrange(population) %>%
  head()
```

With `arrange` we get to decide which column to sort by. To see the states by murder rate, from lowest to highest, we arrange by `rate` instead:

```{r}
murders %>% 
  arrange(rate) %>%
  head()
```

Note that the default behavior is to order in ascending order. In __dplyr__, the function `desc` transforms a vector so that it is in descending order. To sort the table in descending order, we can type:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
murders %>% 
  arrange(desc(rate)) 
```

### 3.1.4.1 Nested sorting 

If we are ordering by a column with ties, we can use a second column to break the tie. Similarly, a third column can be used to break ties between first and second and so on. Here we order by `region`, then within region we order by murder rate:

```{r}
murders %>% 
  arrange(region, rate) %>% 
  head()
```


### 3.1.4.2 The top $n$ 

In the code above, we have used the function `head` to avoid having the page fill up with the entire dataset. If we want to see a larger proportion, we can use the `top_n` function. This function takes a data frame as it's first argument, the number of rows to show in the second, and the variable to filter by in the third. Here is an example of how to see the top 5 rows:

```{r}
murders %>% top_n(5, rate)
```

Note that rows are not sorted by `rate`, only filtered. If we want to sort, we need to use `arrange`.
Note that if the third argument is left blank, `top_n` filters by the last column.

### 4.1 Case Study: Trends in World Health and Economics

<div class="infobox">
  
**Textbook link** The contents are discussed within the [textbook section - 9.1 Case study: new insights on poverty](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/gapminder.html#case-study-new-insights-on-poverty).
  
</div>

---

In this chapter, we will demonstrate how relatively simple **ggplot2** code can create insightful and aesthetically pleasing plots. As motivation we will create plots that that help us better understand trends in world health and economics. We will implement what we learned in the previous sections and learn how to augment the code to perfect plots. As we go through our case study, we will describe relevant general data visualization principles and learn concepts such as *faceting*, *time series plots*, and *ridge plots*. 

[Hans Rosling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Rosling) was the co-founder of the [Gapminder Foundation](http://www.gapminder.org/), an organization dedicated to educating the public by using data to dispel common myths about the so-called developing world. The organization uses data to show how actual trends in health and economics contradict the narratives that emanate from sensationalist media coverage of catastrophes, tragedies, and other unfortunate events. As stated in the Gapminder Foundation's website:

>>> Journalists and lobbyists tell dramatic stories. That’s their job. They tell stories about extraordinary events and unusual people. The piles of dramatic stories pile up in peoples' minds into an over-dramatic worldview and strong negative stress feelings: "The world is getting worse!", "It’s we vs. them!”, “Other people are strange!", "The population just keeps growing!" and "Nobody cares!"

Hans Rosling conveyed actual data-based trends in a dramatic way of his own, using effective data visualization. This section is based on two talks that exemplify this approach to education: [New Insights on Poverty](https://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_reveals_new_insights_on_poverty?language=en) and [The Best Stats You've Ever Seen](https://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_shows_the_best_stats_you_ve_ever_seen). Specifically, in this section, we use data to attempt to answer the following two questions:

1. Is it a fair characterization of today's world to say it is divided into western rich nations and the developing world in Africa, Asia, and Latin America? 

2. Has income inequality across countries worsened during the last 40 years? 

---

### 4.1.2 Gapminder Dataset

To answer these questions, we will be using the `gapminder` dataset provided in __dslabs__. This dataset was created using a number of spreadsheets available from the Gapminder Foundation. You can access the table like this:

```{r load libraries, message=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
library(dslabs)
data(gapminder)
gapminder %>% as_tibble()
```

### Hans Rosling's quiz 

As done in the _New Insights on Poverty_ video, we start by testing our knowledge regarding differences in child mortality across different countries. For each of the six pairs of countries below, which country do you think had the highest child mortality rates in 2015? Which pairs do you think are most similar?

1. Sri Lanka or Turkey
2. Poland or South Korea
3. Malaysia or Russia
4. Pakistan or Vietnam
5. Thailand or South Africa

When answering these questions without data, the non-European countries are typically picked as having higher child mortality rates: Sri Lanka over Turkey, South Korea over Poland, and Malaysia over Russia. It is also common to assume that countries considered to be part of the developing world: Pakistan, Vietnam, Thailand, and South Africa, have similarly high mortality rates. 

To answer these questions __with data__, we can use __dplyr__. For example, for the first comparison we see that:

```{r, message=FALSE}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == 2015 & country %in% c("Sri Lanka","Turkey")) %>% 
  select(country, infant_mortality)
```
Turkey has the higher infant mortality rate. 

We can use this code on all comparisons and find the following:
```{r, echo = FALSE}
comp_table <- tibble(comparison = rep(1:5, each = 2),
           country = c("Sri Lanka", "Turkey", "Poland", "South Korea", "Malaysia", "Russia", "Pakistan","Vietnam","Thailand","South Africa"))

tmp <- gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == 2015) %>% 
  select(country, infant_mortality) %>% 
  mutate(country = as.character(country)) ##to match characters to characters
  
tab <- inner_join(comp_table, tmp, by = "country") %>% select(-comparison)
  
tmp <- bind_cols(slice(tab,seq(1,9,2)), slice(tab,seq(2,10,2)))
names(tmp) <- c("country", "infant mortality", "country", "infant mortality")
if(knitr::is_html_output()){
  knitr::kable(tmp, "html") %>%
    kableExtra::kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = FALSE)
} else{
  knitr::kable(tmp, "latex", booktabs = TRUE) %>%
    kableExtra::kable_styling(font_size = 8)
}
```

We see that the European countries on this list have higher child mortality rates: Poland has a higher rate than South Korea, and Russia has a higher rate than Malaysia. We also see that Pakistan has a much higher rate than Vietnam, and South Africa has a much higher rate than Thailand. It turns out that when Hans Rosling gave this quiz to educated groups of people, the average score was less than 2.5 out of 5, worse than what they would have obtained had they guessed randomly. This implies that more than ignorant, we are misinformed. In this chapter we see how data visualization helps inform us.

### 4.1.3 Life Expectancy and Fertility Rates

The reason for this stems from the preconceived notion that the world is divided into two groups: the western world (Western Europe and North America), characterized by long life spans and small families, versus the developing world (Africa, Asia, and Latin America) characterized by short life spans and large families. But do the data support this dichotomous view?

The necessary data to answer this question is also available in our `gapminder` table. Using our newly learned data visualization skills, we will be able to tackle this challenge.

In order to analyze this world view, our first plot is a scatterplot of life expectancy versus fertility rates (average number of children per woman).  We start by looking at data from about 50 years ago, when perhaps this view was first cemented in our minds.

```{r fertility-versus-life-expectancy-1962, warning=FALSE}
filter(gapminder, year == 1962) %>%
  ggplot(aes(fertility, life_expectancy)) +
  geom_point()
```

Most points fall into two distinct categories: 

1. Life expectancy around 70 years and 3 or fewer children per family.
2. Life expectancy lower than 65 years and more than 5 children per family. 

To confirm that indeed these countries are from the regions we expect, we can use color to represent continent. 

```{r fertility-versus-life-expectancy-1962-with-color}
filter(gapminder, year == 1962) %>%
  ggplot( aes(fertility, life_expectancy, color = continent)) +
  geom_point() 
```

In 1962, "the West versus developing world" view was grounded in some reality. Is this still the case 50 years later?

---

### 4.2.1 Faceting

We could easily plot the 2012 data in the same way we did for 1962. To make comparisons, however, side by side plots are preferable. In __ggplot2__, we can achieve this by _faceting_ variables: we stratify the data by some variable and make the same plot for each strata. 

To achieve faceting, we add a layer with the function `facet_grid`, which automatically separates the plots. This function lets you facet by up to two variables using columns to represent one variable and rows to represent the other. The function expects the row and column variables to be separated by a `~`. Here is an example of a scatterplot with `facet_grid` added as the last layer:

```{r fertility-versus-life-expectancy-facet, warning=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
filter(gapminder, year%in%c(1962, 2012)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(fertility, life_expectancy, col = continent)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_grid(continent~year)
```

We see a plot for each continent/year pair. However, this is just an example and more than what we want, which is simply to compare 1962 and 2012. In this case, there is just one variable and we use  `.` to let facet know that we are not using one of the variables:

```{r fertility-versus-life-expectancy-two-years, warning=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.height=3}
filter(gapminder, year%in%c(1962, 2012)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(fertility, life_expectancy, col = continent)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_grid(. ~ year)
```

This plot clearly shows that the majority of countries have moved from the _developing world_ cluster to the _western world_ one. In 2012, the western versus developing world view no longer makes sense. This is particularly clear when comparing Europe to Asia, the latter of which includes several countries that have made great improvements. 

### 4.2.1.1 `facet_wrap`

To explore how this transformation happened through the years, we can make the plot for several years. For example, we can add 1970, 1980, 1990, and 2000. If we do this, we will not want all the plots on the same row, the default behavior of `facet_grid`, since they will become too thin to show the data. Instead, we will want to use multiple rows and columns. The function `facet_wrap` permits us to do this by automatically wrapping the series of plots so that each display has viewable dimensions:


```{r fertility-versus-life-expectancy-five-years, out.width="100%"}
years <- c(1962, 1980, 1990, 2000, 2012)
continents <- c("Europe", "Asia")
gapminder %>% 
  filter(year %in% years & continent %in% continents) %>%
  ggplot( aes(fertility, life_expectancy, col = continent)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~year) 
```

This plot clearly shows how most Asian countries have improved at a much faster rate than European ones.

### 4.2.1.2 Fixed scales for better comparisons

The default choice of the range of the axes is important. When not using `facet`, this range is determined by the data shown in the plot. When using `facet`, this range is determined by the data shown in all plots and therefore kept fixed across plots. This makes comparisons across plots much easier. For example, in the above plot, we can see that life expectancy has increased and the fertility has decreased across most countries. We see this because the cloud of points moves. This is not the case if we adjust the scales:

```{r facet-without-fixed-scales, warning=FALSE}
filter(gapminder, year%in%c(1962, 2012)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(fertility, life_expectancy, col = continent)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(. ~ year, scales = "free")
```

In the plot above, we have to pay special attention to the range to notice that the plot on the right has a larger life expectancy. 

---

### 4.2.2 Time Series Plots

The visualizations above effectively illustrate that data no longer supports the western versus developing world view. Once we see these plots, new questions emerge. For example, which countries are improving more and which ones less? Was the improvement constant during the last 50 years or was it more accelerated during certain periods? For a closer look that may help answer these questions, we introduce _time series plots_.

Time series plots have time in the x-axis and an outcome or measurement of interest on the y-axis. For example, here is a trend plot of United States fertility rates:

```{r fertility-time-series-plot-points, warning=FALSE}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(country == "United States") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(year, fertility)) +
  geom_point()
```

We see that the trend is not linear at all. Instead there is sharp drop during the 1960s and 1970s to below 2. Then the trend comes back to 2 and stabilizes during the 1990s.

When the points are regularly and densely spaced, as they are here, we create curves by joining the points with lines, to convey that these data are from a single series, here a country. To do this, we use the `geom_line` function instead of `geom_point`. 

```{r fertility-time-series-plot-curve, warning=FALSE}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(country == "United States") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(year, fertility)) +
  geom_line()
```

This is particularly helpful when we look at two countries. If we subset the data to include two countries, one from Europe and one from Asia, then adapt the code above:

```{r wrong-time-series-plot, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
countries <- c("South Korea","Germany")

gapminder %>% filter(country %in% countries) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(year,fertility)) +
  geom_line()
```

Unfortunately, this is __not__ the plot that we want. Rather than a line for each country, the points for both countries are joined. This is actually expected since we have not told `ggplot` anything about wanting two separate lines. To let `ggplot` know that there are two curves that need to be made separately, we assign each point to a `group`, one for each country:


```{r time-series-two-curves, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
countries <- c("South Korea","Germany")

gapminder %>% filter(country %in% countries & !is.na(fertility)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(year, fertility, group = country)) +
  geom_line()
```

But which line goes with which country? We can assign colors to make this distinction.
A useful side-effect of using the `color` argument to assign different colors to the different countries is that the data is automatically grouped:

```{r fertility-time-series-plot}
countries <- c("South Korea","Germany")

gapminder %>% filter(country %in% countries & !is.na(fertility)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(year,fertility, col = country)) +
  geom_line()
```

The plot clearly shows how South Korea's fertility rate dropped drastically during the 1960s and 1970s, and by 1990 had a similar rate to that of Germany.

---

### Labels instead of legends 

For trend plots we recommend labeling the lines rather than using legends since the viewer can quickly see which line is which country. This suggestion actually applies to most plots: labeling is usually preferred over legends.

We demonstrate how we can do this using the life expectancy data. We define a data table with the label locations and then use a second mapping just for these labels:

```{r labels-better-than-legends}
labels <- data.frame(country = countries, x = c(1975,1965), y = c(60,72))

gapminder %>% 
  filter(country %in% countries) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(year, life_expectancy, col = country)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_text(data = labels, aes(x, y, label = country), size = 5) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

The plot clearly shows how an improvement in life expectancy followed the drops in fertility rates. In 1960, Germans lived 15 years longer than South Koreans, although by 2010 the gap is completely closed. It exemplifies the improvement that many non-western countries have achieved in the last 40 years.

### 4.2.3 Transformations

We now shift our attention to the second question related to the commonly held notion that wealth distribution across the world has become worse during the last decades. When general audiences are asked if poor countries have become poorer and rich countries become richer, the majority answers yes. By using stratification, histograms, smooth densities, and boxplots, we will be able to understand if this is in fact the case. First we learn how transformations can sometimes help provide more informative summaries and plots.

The `gapminder` data table includes a column with the countries' gross domestic product (GDP). GDP measures the market value of goods and services produced by a country in a year. The GDP per person is often used as a rough summary of a country's wealth. Here we divide this quantity by 365 to obtain the more interpretable measure _dollars per day_.  Using current US dollars as a unit, a person surviving on an income of less than $2 a day is defined to be living in _absolute poverty_. We add this variable to the data table:


```{r}
gapminder <- gapminder %>%  mutate(dollars_per_day = gdp/population/365)
```

The GDP values are adjusted for inflation and represent current US dollars, so these values are meant to be comparable across the years. Of course, these are country averages and within each country there is much variability. All the graphs and insights described below relate to country averages and not to individuals.

### Log transformation

Here is a histogram of per day incomes from 1970:

```{r dollars-per-day-distribution}
past_year <- 1970
gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == past_year & !is.na(gdp)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(dollars_per_day)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, color = "black")
```

We use the `color = "black"` argument to draw a boundary and clearly distinguish the bins.

In this plot, we see that for the majority of countries, averages are below \$10 a day. However, the majority of the x-axis is dedicated to the `r filter(gapminder, year == past_year & !is.na(gdp)) %>% summarise(x = sum(dollars_per_day>10)) %>% pull(x)` countries with averages above \$10. So the plot is not very informative about countries with values below \$10 a day.

It might be more informative to quickly be able to see how many countries have average daily incomes of about $1 (extremely poor), \$2 (very poor), \$4 (poor), \$8 (middle), \$16 (well off), \$32 (rich), \$64 (very rich) per day. These changes are multiplicative and log transformations convert multiplicative changes into additive ones: when using base 2, a doubling of a value turns into an increase by 1. 

Here is the distribution if we apply a log base 2 transform:
```{r dollars-per-day-distribution-log}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == past_year & !is.na(gdp)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(log2(dollars_per_day))) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, color = "black")
```

In a way this provides a _close-up_ of the mid to lower income countries.

### Which base? 

In the case above, we used base 2 in the log transformations. Other common choices are base $\mathrm{e}$ (the natural log) and base 10.

In general, we do not recommend using the natural log for data exploration and visualization. This is because while $2^2, 2^3, 2^4, \dots$ or $10^2, 10^3, \dots$ are easy to compute in our heads, the same is not true for  $\mathrm{e}^2, \mathrm{e}^3, \dots$, so the scale is not intuitive or easy to interpret.

In the dollars per day example, we used base 2 instead of base 10 because the resulting range is easier to interpret. The range of the values being plotted is `r with(filter(gapminder, year==past_year), range(dollars_per_day, na.rm=TRUE))`. 

In base 10, this turns into a range that includes very few integers: just 0 and 1. 
With base two, our range includes -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. It is easier to compute $2^x$ and $10^x$ when $x$ is an integer and between -10 and 10, so we prefer to have smaller integers in the scale. Another consequence of a limited range is that choosing the binwidth is more challenging. With log base 2, we know that a binwidth of 1 will translate to a bin with range $x$ to $2x$.

For an example in which base 10 makes more sense, consider population sizes. A log base 10 is preferable since the range for these is:

```{r}
filter(gapminder, year == past_year) %>%
  summarize(min = min(population), max = max(population))
```

Here is the histogram of the transformed values:

```{r population-histogram-log10}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == past_year) %>%
  ggplot(aes(log10(population))) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.5, color = "black")
```

In the above, we quickly see that country populations range between ten thousand and ten billion.

### Transform the values or the scale? 

There are two ways we can use log transformations in plots. We can log the values before plotting them or use log scales in the axes. Both approaches are useful and have different strengths. If we log the data, we can more easily interpret intermediate values in the scale. For example, if we see:  

`----1----x----2--------3----`

for log transformed data, we know that the value of $x$ is about 1.5. If the scales are logged:

`----1----x----10------100---`

then, to determine `x`, we need to compute $10^{1.5}$, which is not easy to do in our heads. The advantage of using logged scales is that we see the original values on the axes. However, the advantage of showing logged scales is that the original values are displayed in the plot, which are easier to interpret. For example, we would see "32 dollars a day" instead of "5 log base 2 dollars a day".

As we learned earlier, if we want to scale the axis with logs, we can use the `scale_x_continuous` function. Instead of logging the values first, we apply this layer:

```{r dollars-per-day-log-scale}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == past_year & !is.na(gdp)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(dollars_per_day)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, color = "black") +
  scale_x_continuous(trans = "log2")
```

Note that the log base 10 transformation has its own function: `scale_x_log10()`, but currently base 2 does not, although we could easily define our own.

There are other transformations available through the `trans` argument. As we learn later on, the square root (`sqrt`) transformation is useful when considering counts. The logistic transformation (`logit`) is useful when plotting proportions between 0 and 1. The `reverse` transformation is useful when we want smaller values to be on the right or on top.

### Visualizing multimodal distributions

In the histogram above we see two _bumps_: one at about 4 and another at about 32. In statistics these bumps are sometimes referred to as _modes_. The mode of a distribution is the value with the highest frequency. The mode of the normal distribution is the average. When a distribution, like the one above, doesn't monotonically decrease from the mode, we call the locations where it goes up and down again _local modes_ and say that the distribution has _multiple modes_.

The histogram above suggests that the 1970 country income distribution has two modes: one at about 2 dollars per day (1 in the log 2 scale) and another at about 32 dollars per day (5 in the log 2 scale). This _bimodality_ is consistent with a dichotomous world made up of countries with average incomes less than $8 (3 in the log 2 scale) a day and countries above that. 

### Comparing multiple distributions with boxplots and ridge plots

A histogram showed us that the 1970 income distribution values show a dichotomy. However, the histogram does not show us if the two groups of countries are _west_ versus the _developing_ world.  

Let's start by quickly examining the data by region. We reorder the regions by the median value and use a log scale.

```{r}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == past_year & !is.na(gdp)) %>%
  mutate(region = reorder(region, dollars_per_day, FUN = median)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(dollars_per_day, region)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_continuous(trans = "log2")  
```

We can already see that there is indeed a "west versus the rest" dichotomy: we see two clear groups, with the rich group composed of North America, Northern and Western Europe, New Zealand and Australia. We define groups based on this observation:

```{r}
gapminder <- gapminder %>% 
  mutate(group = case_when(
    region %in% c("Western Europe", "Northern Europe","Southern Europe", 
                    "Northern America", 
                  "Australia and New Zealand") ~ "West",
    region %in% c("Eastern Asia", "South-Eastern Asia") ~ "East Asia",
    region %in% c("Caribbean", "Central America", 
                  "South America") ~ "Latin America",
    continent == "Africa" & 
      region != "Northern Africa" ~ "Sub-Saharan",
    TRUE ~ "Others"))
```

We turn this `group` variable into a factor to control the order of the levels:

```{r}
gapminder <- gapminder %>% 
  mutate(group = factor(group, levels = c("Others", "Latin America", 
                                          "East Asia", "Sub-Saharan",
                                          "West")))
```


In the next section we demonstrate how to visualize and compare distributions across groups.

---

### 4.2.4 Stratify and Boxplot

The exploratory data analysis above has revealed two characteristics about average income distribution in 1970. Using a histogram, we found a bimodal distribution with the modes relating to poor and rich countries. We now want to compare the distribution across these five groups to confirm the "west versus the rest" dichotomy. The number of points in each category is large enough that a summary plot may be useful. We could generate five histograms or five density plots, but it may be more practical to have all the visual summaries in one plot. We therefore start by stacking boxplots next to each other. Note that we add the layer `theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))` to turn the group labels vertical, since they do not fit if we show them horizontally, and remove the axis label to make space.


```{r dollars-per-day-boxplot}
p <- gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == past_year & !is.na(gdp)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(group, dollars_per_day)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  scale_y_continuous(trans = "log2") +
  xlab("") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) 
p
```

Boxplots have the limitation that by summarizing the data into five numbers, we might miss important characteristics of the data. One way to avoid this is by showing the data.

```{r dollars-per-day-boxplot-with-data}
p + geom_point(alpha = 0.5)
```


### Ridge plots 

Showing each individual point does not always reveal important characteristics of the distribution. Although not the case here, when the number of data points is so large that there is over-plotting, showing the data can be counterproductive. Boxplots help with this by providing a five-number summary, but this has limitations too. For example, boxplots will not permit us to discover bimodal distributions. To see this, note that the two plots below are summarizing the same dataset:

```{r boxplot-dont-show-bimodal, warning=FALSE, out.width="100%", message = FALSE, echo=FALSE, fig.height=3}
set.seed(1987)
z <- sample(c(0,1), 1000, replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.25, 0.75))
x <- rnorm(100)*z + rnorm(100, 5)*(1 - z)
p1 <- qplot(x, geom = "density", fill = 1, show.legend=FALSE, alpha = 0.2) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits=c(-4,8.5))
p2 <- qplot("", x, geom="boxplot")
gridExtra::grid.arrange(p1, p2, nrow = 1)
```

In cases in which we are concerned that the boxplot summary is too simplistic, we can show stacked smooth densities or histograms. We refer to these as _ridge plots_. Because we are used to visualizing densities with values in the x-axis, we stack them vertically. Also, because more space is needed in this approach, it is convenient to overlay them. The package __ggridges__ provides a convenient function for doing this. Here is the income data shown above with boxplots but with a _ridge plot_. 

```{r ridge-plot, message=FALSE}
library(ggridges)
p <- gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == past_year & !is.na(dollars_per_day)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(dollars_per_day, group)) + 
  scale_x_continuous(trans = "log2") 
p  + geom_density_ridges() 
```

Note that we have to invert the `x` and `y` used for the boxplot. A useful `geom_density_ridges` parameter is `scale`, which lets you determine the amount of overlap, with `scale = 1` meaning no overlap and larger values resulting in more overlap. 

If the number of data points is small enough, we can add them to the ridge plot using the following code:

```{r ridge-plot-with-points, message=FALSE}
p + geom_density_ridges(jittered_points = TRUE)
```

By default, the height of the points is jittered and should not be interpreted in any way. To show data points, but without using jitter we can use the following code to add what is referred to as a _rug representation_ of the data.  
```{r ridge-plot-with-rug, message=FALSE}
p + geom_density_ridges(jittered_points = TRUE, 
                        position = position_points_jitter(height = 0),
                        point_shape = '|', point_size = 3, 
                        point_alpha = 1, alpha = 0.7)
```

### 4.2.5 Comparing Distributions

#### Example: 1970 versus 2010 income distributions

Data exploration clearly shows that in 1970 there was a "west versus the rest" dichotomy. But does this dichotomy persist? Let's use `facet_grid` see how the distributions have changed. To start, we will focus on two groups: the west and the rest. We make four histograms.

```{r income-hist-west-v-developing-two-years}
past_year <- 1970
present_year <- 2010
years <- c(past_year, present_year)
gapminder %>% 
  filter(year %in% years & !is.na(gdp)) %>%
  mutate(west = ifelse(group == "West", "West", "Developing")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(dollars_per_day)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, color = "black") +
  scale_x_continuous(trans = "log2") + 
  facet_grid(year ~ west)
```

Before we interpret the findings of this plot, we notice that there are more countries represented in the 2010 histograms than in 1970: the total counts are larger. One reason for this is that several countries were founded after 1970. For example, the Soviet Union divided into several countries during the 1990s. Another reason is that data was available for more countries in 2010.  

We remake the plots using only countries with data available for both years. In the data wrangling part of this book, we will learn __tidyverse__ tools that permit us to  write efficient code for this, but here we can use simple code using the `intersect` function:

```{r}
country_list_1 <- gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == past_year & !is.na(dollars_per_day)) %>% 
  pull(country)

country_list_2 <- gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == present_year & !is.na(dollars_per_day)) %>% 
  pull(country)
      
country_list <- intersect(country_list_1, country_list_2)
```

These `r length(country_list)` account for 
`r round(gapminder %>% filter(year==present_year) %>% summarize(perc=sum(population[country%in%country_list], na.rm=TRUE)/sum(population, na.rm=TRUE)) %>% pull(perc)*100 )`% of the world population, so this subset should be representative.

Let's remake the plot, but only for this subset by simply adding `country %in% country_list` to the `filter` function:

```{r income-histogram-west-v-devel, echo=FALSE}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(year %in% years & country %in% country_list) %>%
  mutate(west = ifelse(group == "West", "West", "Developing")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(dollars_per_day)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, color = "black") +
  scale_x_continuous(trans = "log2") + 
  facet_grid(year ~ west)
```

We now see that the rich countries have become a bit richer, but percentage-wise, the poor countries appear to have improved more. In particular, we see that the proportion of _developing_ countries earning more than $16 a day increased substantially. 

To see which specific regions improved the most, we can remake the boxplots we made above, but now adding the year 2010 and then using facet to compare the two years.


```{r  income-histogram-by-region, out.width="100%"}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(year %in% years & country %in% country_list) %>%
  ggplot(aes(group, dollars_per_day)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) +
  scale_y_continuous(trans = "log2") +
  xlab("") +
  facet_grid(. ~ year)
```

Here, we pause to introduce another powerful __ggplot2__ feature. Because we want to compare each region before and after, it would be convenient to have the `r past_year` boxplot next to the `r present_year` boxplot for each region. In general, comparisons are easier when data are plotted next to each other.

So instead of faceting, we keep the data from each year together and ask  to color (or fill) them depending on the year. Note that groups are automatically separated by year and each pair of boxplots drawn next to each other. Because year is a number, we turn it into a factor since __ggplot2__ automatically assigns a color to each category of a factor. Note that we have to convert the year columns from numeric to factor. 

```{r income-histogram-west-v-devel-by-year}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(year %in% years & country %in% country_list) %>%
  mutate(year = factor(year)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(group, dollars_per_day, fill = year)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) +
  scale_y_continuous(trans = "log2") +
  xlab("") 
```

Finally, we point out that if what we are most interested in is comparing before and after values, it might make more sense to plot the percentage increases. We are still not ready to learn to code this, but here is what the plot would look like:

```{r income-west-v-devel-before-after-ratio, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(year %in% years & country %in% country_list) %>%
  mutate(year = ifelse(year == past_year, "past", "present")) %>%
  select(country, group, year, dollars_per_day) %>%
  spread(year, dollars_per_day)  %>%
  mutate(percent_increase = (present-past)/past*100) %>%
  mutate(group = reorder(group, percent_increase, FUN = median)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(group, percent_increase)) +
  geom_boxplot() + 
  geom_point(show.legend = FALSE) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) +
  xlab("") + 
  ylab(paste("Percent increase:", past_year, "to", present_year)) 
```
  

The previous data exploration suggested that the income gap between rich and poor countries has narrowed considerably during the last 40 years. 
We used a series of histograms and boxplots to see this. We suggest a succinct way to convey this message with just one plot. 

Let's start by noting that density plots for income distribution in `r past_year` and `r present_year` deliver the message that the gap is closing:

```{r income-smooth-density-by-year, out.width="100%", fig.height=3}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(year %in% years & country %in% country_list) %>%
  ggplot(aes(dollars_per_day)) +
  geom_density(fill = "grey") + 
  scale_x_continuous(trans = "log2") + 
  facet_grid(. ~ year)
```

In the `r past_year` plot, we see two clear modes: poor and rich countries. In `r present_year`, it appears that some of the poor countries have shifted towards the right, closing the gap. 

The next message we need to convey is that the reason for this change in distribution is that several poor countries became richer, rather than some rich countries becoming poorer. To do this, we can assign a color to the groups we identified during data exploration. 

However, we first need to learn how to make these smooth densities in a way that preserves information on the number of countries in each group. To understand why we need this, note the discrepancy in the size of each group:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
tmp <- gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == past_year & country %in% country_list) %>%
  mutate(group = ifelse(group == "West", "West", "Developing")) %>% 
  group_by(group) %>% 
  summarize(n=n()) %>%
  spread(group, n)
if(knitr::is_html_output()){
  knitr::kable(tmp, "html") %>%
    kableExtra::kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = FALSE)
} else{
  knitr::kable(tmp, "latex", booktabs = TRUE) %>%
    kableExtra::kable_styling(font_size = 8)
}
```

But when we overlay two densities, the default is to have the area represented by each distribution add up to 1, regardless of the size of each group:

```{r income-smooth-density-by-year-west-v-developing}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(year %in% years & country %in% country_list) %>%
  mutate(group = ifelse(group == "West", "West", "Developing")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(dollars_per_day, fill = group)) +
  scale_x_continuous(trans = "log2") +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.2) + 
  facet_grid(year ~ .)
```

This makes it appear as if there are the same number of countries in each group. To change this, we will need to learn to access computed variables with `geom_density` function.

### 4.2.6 Density Plots

 [textbook section - 9.7.5 Weighted densities](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/gapminder.html#weighted-densities).
  
</div>

---

### Accessing computed variables 

To have the areas of these densities be proportional to the size of the groups, we can simply multiply the y-axis values by the size of the group. From the `geom_density` help file, we see that the functions compute a variable called `count` that does exactly this. We want this variable to be on the y-axis rather than the density.

In __ggplot2__, we access these variables by surrounding the name with two dots. We will therefore use the following mapping:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
aes(x = dollars_per_day, y = ..count..)
```

We can now create the desired plot by simply changing the mapping in the previous code chunk. We will also expand the limits of the x-axis.


```{r income-smooth-density-counts}
p <- gapminder %>% 
  filter(year %in% years & country %in% country_list) %>%
  mutate(group = ifelse(group == "West", "West", "Developing")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(dollars_per_day, y = ..count.., fill = group)) +
  scale_x_continuous(trans = "log2", limit = c(0.125, 300))

p + geom_density(alpha = 0.2) + 
  facet_grid(year ~ .)
```

If we want the densities to be smoother, we use the `bw` argument so that the same bandwidth is used in each density. We selected 0.75 after trying out several values.

```{r income-smooth-density-counts-by-year}
p + geom_density(alpha = 0.2, bw = 0.75) + facet_grid(year ~ .)
```

This plot now shows what is happening very clearly. The developing world distribution is changing. A third mode appears consisting of the countries that most narrowed the gap. 

To visualize if any of the groups defined above are driving this we can quickly make a ridge plot:

```{r ridge-plot-income-five-regions, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(year %in% years & !is.na(dollars_per_day)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(dollars_per_day, group)) + 
  scale_x_continuous(trans = "log2") + 
  geom_density_ridges(adjust = 1.5) +
  facet_grid(. ~ year)
```

Another way to achieve this is by stacking the densities on top of each other:

```{r income-smooth-density-counts-by-region-and-year}
gapminder %>% 
    filter(year %in% years & country %in% country_list) %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  mutate(weight = population/sum(population)*2) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  ggplot(aes(dollars_per_day, fill = group)) +
  scale_x_continuous(trans = "log2", limit = c(0.125, 300)) + 
  geom_density(alpha = 0.2, bw = 0.75, position = "stack") + 
  facet_grid(year ~ .) 
```

Here we can clearly see how the distributions for East Asia, Latin America, and others shift markedly to the right. While Sub-Saharan Africa remains stagnant. 

Notice that we order the levels of the group so that the West's density is plotted first, then Sub-Saharan Africa. Having the two extremes plotted first allows us to see the remaining bimodality better.


### Weighted densities 

As a final point, we note that these distributions weigh every country the same. So if most of the population is improving, but living in a very large country, such as China, we might not appreciate this. We can actually weight the smooth densities using the `weight` mapping argument. The plot then looks like this:

```{r income-smooth-density-counts-by-region-year-weighted, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
gapminder %>% 
    filter(year %in% years & country %in% country_list) %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  mutate(weight = population/sum(population)*2) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  ggplot(aes(dollars_per_day, fill = group, weight = weight)) +
  scale_x_continuous(trans = "log2", limit = c(0.125, 300)) + 
  geom_density(alpha = 0.2, bw = 0.75, position = "stack") + facet_grid(year ~ .) 
```

This particular figure shows very clearly how the income distribution gap is closing with most of the poor remaining in Sub-Saharan Africa.

### 4.2.7 Ecological Fallacy

Throughout this section, we have been comparing regions of the world. We have seen that, on average, some regions do better than others. In this section, we focus on describing the importance of variability within the groups when examining the relationship between a country's infant mortality rates and average income.

We define a few more regions and compare the averages across regions:

```{r ecological-fallacy-averages, echo=FALSE}
gapminder <- gapminder %>% 
  mutate(group = case_when(
    region %in% c("Western Europe", "Northern Europe",
                  "Southern Europe", "Northern America", 
                  "Australia and New Zealand") ~ "West",
    region %in% "Northern Africa" ~ "Northern Africa",
    region %in% c("Eastern Asia", "South-Eastern Asia") ~ "East Asia",
    region == "Southern Asia"~ "Southern Asia",
    region %in% c("Central America", "South America", 
                  "Caribbean") ~ "Latin America",
    continent == "Africa" & 
      region != "Northern Africa" ~ "Sub-Saharan",
    region %in% c("Melanesia", "Micronesia", 
                  "Polynesia") ~ "Pacific Islands"))
surv_income <- gapminder %>% 
  filter(year %in% present_year & !is.na(gdp) & 
           !is.na(infant_mortality) & !is.na(group)) %>%
  group_by(group) %>%
  summarize(income = sum(gdp)/sum(population)/365,
            infant_survival_rate = 
              1 - sum(infant_mortality/1000*population)/sum(population)) 

#surv_income %>% arrange(income) %>% print(n=nrow(surv_income))

surv_income %>% ggplot(aes(income, infant_survival_rate, label = group, color = group)) +
  scale_x_continuous(trans = "log2", limits = c(0.25, 150)) +
  scale_y_continuous(trans = "logit", limit = c(0.875, .9981), 
                     breaks = c(.85,.90,.95,.99,.995,.998)) +
  geom_label_repel(size = 3, show.legend = FALSE)
```

The relationship between these two variables is almost perfectly linear and the graph shows a dramatic difference. While in the West less than 0.5% of infants die, in Sub-Saharan Africa the rate is higher than 6%! 

Note that the plot uses a new transformation, the logistic transformation.

### Logistic transformation 
The logistic or logit transformation for a proportion or rate $p$ is defined as: 

$$f(p) = \log \left( \frac{p}{1-p} \right)$$

When $p$ is a proportion or probability, the quantity that is being logged, $p/(1-p)$, is called the _odds_. In this case $p$ is the proportion of infants that survived. The odds tell us how many more infants are expected to survive than to die. The log transformation makes this symmetric. If the rates are the same, then the log odds is 0. Fold increases or decreases turn into positive and negative increments, respectively.

This scale is useful when we want to highlight differences near 0 or 1. For survival rates this is important because a survival rate of 90% is unacceptable, while a survival of 99% is relatively good. We would much prefer a survival rate closer to 99.9%. We want our scale to highlight these difference and the logit does this. Note that 99.9/0.1 is about 10 times bigger than 99/1 which is about 10 times larger than 90/10. By using the log, these fold changes turn into constant increases.

### Show the data 

Now, back to our plot. Based on the plot above, do we conclude that a country with a low income is destined to have low survival rate? Do we conclude that survival rates in Sub-Saharan Africa are all lower than in Southern Asia, which in turn are lower than in the Pacific Islands, and so on?

Jumping to this conclusion based on a plot showing averages is referred to as the _ecological fallacy_. The almost perfect relationship between survival rates and income is only observed for the averages at the region level. Once we show all the data, we see a somewhat more complicated story:

```{r ecological-fallacy-all-data, echo=FALSE}
library(ggrepel)
highlight <- c("Sierra Leone", "Mauritius",  "Sudan", "Botswana", "Tunisia",
               "Cambodia","Singapore","Chile", "Haiti", "Bolivia",
               "United States","Sweden", "Angola", "Serbia")

gapminder %>% filter(year %in% present_year & !is.na(gdp) & !is.na(infant_mortality) & !is.na(group) ) %>%
  mutate(country_name = ifelse(country %in% highlight, as.character(country), "")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(dollars_per_day, 1 - infant_mortality/1000, col = group, label = country_name)) +
  scale_x_continuous(trans = "log2", limits=c(0.25, 150)) +
  scale_y_continuous(trans = "logit",limit=c(0.875, .9981),
                     breaks=c(.85,.90,.95,.99,.995,.998)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, size = 3) +
  geom_text_repel(size = 4, show.legend = FALSE)
```

Specifically, we see that there is a large amount of variability. We see that countries from the same regions can be quite different and that countries with the same income can have different survival rates. For example, while on average Sub-Saharan Africa had the worse health and economic outcomes, there is wide variability within that group. Mauritius and Botswana are doing better than Angola and Sierra Leone, with Mauritius comparable to Western countries.

### 5.1 Introduction to Data Visualization Principles

We have already provided some rules to follow as we created plots for our examples. Here, we aim to provide some general principles we can use as a guide for effective data visualization. Much of this section is based on a talk by [Karl Broman](http://kbroman.org/) titled ["Creating Effective Figures and Tables"](https://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~kbroman/presentations/graphs2017.pdf) and includes some of the figures which were made with code that Karl makes available on his [GitHub repository](https://github.com/kbroman/Talk_Graphs), as well as class notes from [Peter Aldhous' Introduction to Data Visualization course](http://paldhous.github.io/ucb/2016/dataviz/index.html). Following Karl's approach, we show some examples of plot styles we should avoid, explain how to improve them, and use these as motivation for a list of principles. We compare and contrast plots that follow these principles to those that don't.

The principles are mostly based on research related to how humans detect patterns and make visual comparisons. The preferred approaches are those that best fit the way our brains process visual information. When deciding on a visualization approach, it is also important to keep our goal in mind. We may be comparing a viewable number of quantities, describing distributions for categories or numeric values, comparing the data from two groups, or describing the relationship between two variables. As a final note, we want to emphasize that for a data scientist it is important to adapt and optimize graphs to the audience. For example, an exploratory plot made for ourselves will be different than a chart intended to communicate a finding to a general audience.

We will be using these libraries:


```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(dslabs)
library(gridExtra)
```

---

### 5.2 Encoding Data Using Visual Cues


We start by describing some principles for encoding data. There are several approaches at our disposal including position, aligned lengths, angles, area, brightness, and color hue. 


```{r, echo=FALSE}
browsers <- data.frame(Browser = rep(c("Opera","Safari","Firefox","IE","Chrome"),2),
                       Year = rep(c(2000, 2015), each = 5),
                       Percentage = c(3,21,23,28,26, 2,22,21,27,29)) %>%
  mutate(Browser = reorder(Browser, Percentage))
```


To illustrate how some of these strategies compare, let's suppose we want to report the results from two hypothetical polls regarding browser preference taken in 2000 and then 2015. For each year, we are simply comparing five quantities – the five percentages. A widely used graphical representation of percentages, popularized by Microsoft Excel, is the pie chart:


```{r piechart,  echo=FALSE}
library(ggthemes)
p1 <- browsers %>% ggplot(aes(x = "", y = Percentage, fill = Browser)) +
  geom_bar(width = 1, stat = "identity", col = "black")  + coord_polar(theta = "y") +
  theme_excel() + xlab("") + ylab("") +
  theme(axis.text=element_blank(), 
        axis.ticks = element_blank(), 
        panel.grid  = element_blank()) +
  facet_grid(.~Year)
p1
```


Here we are representing quantities with both areas and angles, since both the angle and area of each pie slice are proportional to the quantity the slice represents. This turns out to be a sub-optimal choice since, as demonstrated by perception studies, humans are not good at precisely quantifying angles and are even worse when area is the only available visual cue. The donut chart is an example of a plot that uses only area:

```{r donutchart, echo=FALSE}
browsers %>% ggplot(aes(x = 2, y = Percentage, fill = Browser)) +
  geom_bar(width = 1, stat = "identity", col = "black")  + 
  scale_x_continuous(limits=c(0.5,2.5)) + coord_polar(theta = "y") +
  theme_excel() + xlab("") + ylab("") +
  theme(axis.text=element_blank(), 
        axis.ticks = element_blank(), 
        panel.grid  = element_blank()) +
  facet_grid(.~Year)

```

To see how hard it is to quantify angles and area, note that the rankings and all the percentages in the plots above changed from 2000 to 2015. Can you determine the actual percentages and rank the browsers' popularity? Can you see how the percentages changed from 2000 to 2015? It is not easy to tell from the plot. In fact, the `pie` R function help file states that:

> Pie charts are a very bad way of displaying information. The eye is good at judging linear measures and bad at judging relative areas. A bar chart or dot chart is a preferable way of displaying this type of data.


In this case, simply showing the numbers is not only clearer, but would also save on printing costs if printing a paper copy:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
if(knitr::is_html_output()){
  browsers %>% spread(Year, Percentage) %>% knitr::kable("html") %>%
    kableExtra::kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = FALSE)
} else{
   browsers %>% spread(Year, Percentage) %>% 
    knitr::kable("latex", booktabs = TRUE) %>%
    kableExtra::kable_styling(font_size = 8)
}
```

The preferred way to plot these quantities is to use length and position as visual cues, since humans are much better at judging linear measures. The barplot uses this approach by using bars of length proportional to the quantities of interest. By adding horizontal lines at strategically chosen values, in this case at every multiple of 10, we ease the visual burden of quantifying through the position of the top of the bars. Compare and contrast the information we can extract from the two figures.

```{r two-barplots, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.width = 6, fig.height = 5}
p2 <-browsers %>%
  ggplot(aes(Browser, Percentage)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", width=0.5) +
  ylab("Percent using the Browser") +
  facet_grid(.~Year)
grid.arrange(p1, p2, nrow = 2)
```

Notice how much easier it is to see the differences in the barplot. In fact, we can now determine the actual percentages by following a horizontal line to the x-axis. 

If for some reason you need to make a pie chart, label each pie slice with its respective percentage so viewers do not have to infer them from the angles or area:

```{r excel-barplot, warning = FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library(scales)
browsers <- filter(browsers, Year == 2015)
at <- with(browsers, 100 - cumsum(c(0,Percentage[-length(Percentage)])) - 0.5*Percentage)  
label <- percent(browsers$Percentage/100)
browsers %>% ggplot(aes(x = "", y = Percentage, fill = Browser)) +
  geom_bar(width = 1, stat = "identity", col = "black")  + coord_polar(theta = "y") +
  theme_excel() + xlab("") + ylab("") + ggtitle("2015") +
  theme(axis.text=element_blank(), 
        axis.ticks = element_blank(), 
        panel.grid  = element_blank()) +
annotate(geom = "text", 
              x = 1.62, 
              y =  at, 
              label = label, size=4)
```

In general, when displaying quantities, position and length are preferred over angles and/or area. Brightness and color are even harder to quantify than angles. But, as we will see later, they are sometimes useful when more than two dimensions must be displayed at once.

---

### 5.3 Know When to Include Zero

When using barplots, it is misinformative not to start the bars at 0. This is because, by using a barplot, we are implying the length is proportional to the quantities being displayed. By avoiding 0, relatively small differences can be made to look much bigger than they actually are. This approach is often used by politicians or media organizations trying to exaggerate a difference. Below is an illustrative example used by Peter Aldhous in this lecture: [http://paldhous.github.io/ucb/2016/dataviz/week2.html](http://paldhous.github.io/ucb/2016/dataviz/week2.html).

(Source: [Fox News, via Media Matters](http://mediamatters.org/blog/2013/04/05/fox-news-newest-dishonest-chart-immigration-enf/193507).)

From the plot above, it appears that apprehensions have almost tripled when, in fact, they have only increased by about 16%. Starting the graph at 0 illustrates this clearly:

```{r barplot-from-zero-1, echo=FALSE}
data.frame(Year = as.character(c(2011, 2012, 2013)),Southwest_Border_Apprehensions = c(165244,170223,192298)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(Year, Southwest_Border_Apprehensions )) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "yellow", col = "black", width = 0.65) 
```

Here is another example, described in detail in a Flowing Data blog post:

  <center>
   
  <figure>
  <img src="./images/Bush-cuts.png" alt="R Studio" style="width:700px">
  </figure> 
  
  </center>

(Source: Fox News, via [Flowing Data](http://flowingdata.com/2012/08/06/fox-news-continues-charting-excellence/).)

This plot makes a 13% increase look like a five fold change. Here is the appropriate plot:

```{r barplot-from-zero-2, echo=FALSE}
data.frame(date = c("Now", "Jan 1, 2013"), tax_rate = c(35, 39.6)) %>%
  mutate(date = reorder(date, tax_rate)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(date, tax_rate)) + 
  ylab("") + xlab("") +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "yellow", col = "black", width = 0.5) + 
  ggtitle("Top Tax Rate If Bush Tax Cut Expires")
```

Finally, here is an extreme example that makes a very small difference of under 2% look like a 10-100 fold change:

  <center>

(Source: 
[Venezolana de Televisión via Pakistan Today](https://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2018/05/18/whats-at-stake-in-venezuelan-presidential-vote) and Diego Mariano.)

Here is the appropriate plot:

```{r barplot-from-zero-3, echo=FALSE}
data.frame(Candidate = factor(c("Maduro", "Capriles"), levels = c("Maduro", "Capriles")),
           Percent = c(50.66, 49.07)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(Candidate, Percent, fill = Candidate)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", width = 0.65, show.legend = FALSE) 
```

When using position rather than length, it is then not necessary to include 0. This is particularly the case when we want to compare differences between groups relative to the within-group variability. Here is an illustrative example showing country average life expectancy stratified across continents in 2012:

```{r points-plot-not-from-zero, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%",  fig.width = 6, fig.height = 3}
p1 <- gapminder %>% filter(year == 2012) %>%
  ggplot(aes(continent, life_expectancy)) +
  geom_point()
p2 <- p1 +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 84))
grid.arrange(p2, p1, ncol = 2)
```

Note that in the plot on the left, which includes 0, the space between 0 and 43 adds no information and makes it harder to compare the between and within group variability.


### 5.4 Do Not Distort Quantities

During President Barack Obama’s 2011 State of the Union Address, the following chart was used to compare the US GDP to the GDP of four competing nations:

  </figure> 
  
  </center>

(Source: [The 2011 State of the Union Address](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kl2g40GoRxg))

Judging by the area of the circles, the US appears to have an economy over five times larger than China's and over 30 times larger than France's. However, if we look at the actual numbers, we see that this is not the case. The actual ratios are 2.6 and 5.8 times bigger than China and France, respectively. The reason for this distortion is that the radius, rather than the area, was made to be proportional to the quantity, which implies that the proportion between the areas is squared: 2.6 turns into 6.5 and 5.8 turns into 34.1. Here is a comparison of the circles we get if we make the value proportional to the radius and to the area:

```{r area-not-radius, echo = FALSE}
gdp <- c(14.6, 5.7, 5.3, 3.3, 2.5)
gdp_data <- data.frame(Country = rep(c("United States", "China", "Japan", "Germany", "France"),2),
           y = factor(rep(c("Radius","Area"),each=5), levels = c("Radius", "Area")),
           GDP= c(gdp^2/min(gdp^2), gdp/min(gdp))) %>% 
   mutate(Country = reorder(Country, GDP))
gdp_data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(Country, y, size = GDP)) + 
  geom_point(show.legend = FALSE, color = "blue") + 
  scale_size(range = c(2,25)) +
  coord_flip() + ylab("") + xlab("")
```

Not surprisingly, __ggplot2__ defaults to using area rather than
radius. Of course, in this case, we really should not be using area at all since we can use position and length:

```{r barplot-better-than-area, out.width="50%", echo=FALSE}
gdp_data %>% 
  filter(y == "Area") %>%
  ggplot(aes(Country, GDP)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", width = 0.5) + 
  ylab("GDP in trillions of US dollars")
```

### 5.5 Order by a Meaningful Value

When one of the axes is used to show categories, as is done in barplots, the default __ggplot2__ behavior is to order the categories alphabetically when they are defined by character strings. If they are defined by factors, they are ordered by the factor levels. We rarely want to use alphabetical order. Instead, we should order by a meaningful quantity. In all the cases above, the barplots were ordered by the values being displayed. The exception was the graph showing barplots comparing browsers. In this case, we kept the order the same across the barplots to ease the comparison. Specifically, instead of ordering the browsers separately in the two years, we ordered both years by the average value of 2000 and 2015. 


We previously learned how to use the `reorder` function, which helps us achieve this goal.
To appreciate how the right order can help convey a message, suppose we want to create a plot to compare the murder rate across states. We are particularly interested in the most dangerous and safest states. Note the difference when we order alphabetically (the default) versus when we order by the actual rate:

```{r do-not-order-alphabetically, fig.height = 5, echo=FALSE}
data(murders)
p1 <- murders %>% mutate(murder_rate = total / population * 100000) %>%
  ggplot(aes(state, murder_rate)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity") +
  coord_flip() +
  theme(axis.text.y = element_text(size = 8))  +
  xlab("")

p2 <- murders %>% mutate(murder_rate = total / population * 100000) %>%
  mutate(state = reorder(state, murder_rate)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(state, murder_rate)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity") +
  coord_flip() +
  theme(axis.text.y = element_text(size = 8))  +
  xlab("")

grid.arrange(p1, p2, ncol = 2)
```

We can make the second plot like this:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
data(murders)
murders %>% mutate(murder_rate = total / population * 100000) %>%
  mutate(state = reorder(state, murder_rate)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(state, murder_rate)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity") +
  coord_flip() +
  theme(axis.text.y = element_text(size = 6)) +
  xlab("")
```

The `reorder` function lets us reorder groups as well. Earlier we saw an example related to income distributions across regions. Here are the two versions plotted against each other:

```{r reorder-boxplot-example, out.width="100%", echo=FALSE}
past_year <- 1970
p1 <- gapminder %>% 
  mutate(dollars_per_day = gdp/population/365) %>%
  filter(year == past_year & !is.na(gdp)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(region, dollars_per_day)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_point() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) +
  xlab("")

p2 <- gapminder %>% 
  mutate(dollars_per_day = gdp/population/365) %>%
  filter(year == past_year & !is.na(gdp)) %>%
  mutate(region = reorder(region, dollars_per_day, FUN = median)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(region, dollars_per_day)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_point() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) +
  xlab("")

grid.arrange(p1, p2, nrow=1)
```

The first orders the regions alphabetically, while the second orders them by the group's median.

### 5.6 Show the Data

We have focused on displaying single quantities across categories. We now shift our attention to displaying data, with a focus on comparing groups. 

To motivate our first principle, "show the data", we go back to our artificial example of describing heights to ET, an extraterrestrial. This time let's assume ET is interested in the difference in heights between males and females. A commonly seen plot used for comparisons between groups, popularized by software such as Microsoft Excel, is the dynamite plot, which shows the average and standard errors (standard errors are defined in a later chapter, but do not confuse them with the standard deviation of the data). The plot looks like this:

```{r show-data-1, echo=FALSE, fig.height=6}
data("heights")
p1 <- heights %>% 
  group_by(sex) %>% 
  summarize(average = mean(height), se=sd(height)/sqrt(n())) %>%
  ggplot(aes(sex, average)) + 
  theme_excel() + 
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = average - 2*se, ymax = average+2*se), width = 0.25) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", width=0.5, fill = "blue", color = "black") +
  ylab("Height in inches")
p1
```

The average of each group is represented by the top of each bar and the antennae extend out from the average to the average plus two standard errors.  If all ET receives is this plot, he will have little information on what to expect if he meets a group of human males and females. The bars go to 0: does this mean there are tiny humans measuring less than one foot? Are all males taller than the tallest females? Is there a range of heights? ET can't answer these questions since we have provided almost no information on the height distribution.

This brings us to our first principle: show the data. This simple __ggplot2__ code already generates a more informative plot than the barplot by simply showing all the data points:

```{r show-data-2}
heights %>% 
  ggplot(aes(sex, height)) + 
  geom_point() 
```

For example, this plot gives us an idea of the range of the data. However, this plot has limitations as well, since we can't really see all the `r sum(heights$sex=="Female")` and `r sum(heights$sex=="Male")` points plotted for females and males, respectively, and many points are plotted on top of each other. As we have previously described, visualizing the distribution is much more informative. But before doing this, we point out two ways we can improve a plot showing all the points.

The first is to add _jitter_, which adds a small random shift to each point. In this case, adding horizontal jitter does not alter the interpretation, since the point heights do not change, but we minimize the number of points that fall on top of each other and, therefore, get a better visual sense of how the data is distributed. A second improvement comes from using _alpha blending_: making the points somewhat transparent. The more points fall on top of each other, the darker the plot, which also helps us get a sense of how the points are distributed. Here is the same plot with jitter and alpha blending:

```{r show-points-with-jitter}
heights %>% 
  ggplot(aes(sex, height)) +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.1, alpha = 0.2) 
```

Now we start getting a sense that, on average, males are taller than females. We also note dark horizontal bands of points, demonstrating that many report values that are rounded to the nearest integer.

---

### 5.7 Ease Comparisons: Use common axes

Since there are so many points, it is more effective to show distributions rather than individual points. We therefore show histograms for each group:

```{r common-axes-histograms-wrong, echo=FALSE}
heights %>% 
  ggplot(aes(height, ..density..)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, color="black") +
  facet_grid(.~sex, scales = "free_x")
```

However, from this plot it is not immediately obvious that males are, on average, taller than females. We have to look carefully to notice that the x-axis has a higher range of values in the male histogram. An important principle here is to **keep the axes the same** when comparing data across two plots. Below we see how the comparison becomes easier:

```{r common-axes-histograms-right, echo=FALSE}
heights %>% 
  ggplot(aes(height, ..density..)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, color="black") +
  facet_grid(.~sex)
```

---

### Align plots vertically to see horizontal changes and horizontally to see vertical changes

In these histograms, the visual cue related to decreases or increases in height are shifts to the left or right, respectively: horizontal changes. Aligning the plots vertically helps us see this change when the axes are fixed:

```{r common-axes-histograms-right-2, echo = FALSE}
p2 <- heights %>% 
  ggplot(aes(height, ..density..)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, color="black") +
  facet_grid(sex~.)
p2
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
heights %>% 
  ggplot(aes(height, ..density..)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, color="black") +
  facet_grid(sex~.)
```

This plot makes it much easier to notice that men are, on average, taller. 

If , we want the more compact summary provided by boxplots, we then align them horizontally since, by default, boxplots move up and down with changes in height. Following our _show the data_ principle, we then overlay all the data points: 

```{r boxplot-with-points-with-jitter, echo=FALSE}
p3 <- heights %>% 
  ggplot(aes(sex, height)) + 
  geom_boxplot(coef=3) + 
  geom_jitter(width = 0.1, alpha = 0.2) +
  ylab("Height in inches")
p3
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
 heights %>% 
  ggplot(aes(sex, height)) + 
  geom_boxplot(coef=3) + 
  geom_jitter(width = 0.1, alpha = 0.2) +
  ylab("Height in inches")
```

Now contrast and compare these three plots, based on exactly the same data:

```{r show-the-data-comparison, out.width="100%", echo=FALSE}
grid.arrange(p1, p2, p3, ncol = 3)
```

Notice how much more we learn from the two plots on the right. Barplots are useful for showing one number, but not very useful when we want to describe distributions.

---

### 5.8 Consider Transformations

We have motivated the use of the log transformation in cases where the changes are multiplicative. Population size was an example in which we found a log transformation to yield a more informative transformation. 

The combination of an incorrectly chosen barplot and a failure to use a log transformation when one is merited can be particularly distorting. As an example, consider this barplot showing the average population sizes for each continent in 2015:

```{r no-transformations-wrong-use-of-barplot, echo=FALSE}
data(gapminder)
p1 <- gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == 2015) %>%
  group_by(continent) %>% 
  summarize(population = mean(population)) %>%
  mutate(continent = reorder(continent, population)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(continent, population/10^6)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", width=0.5, fill="blue") +
  theme_excel() + 
  ylab("Population in Millions") +
  xlab("Continent")
p1
```

From this plot, one would conclude that countries in Asia are much more populous than in other continents. Following the _show the data_ principle, we quickly notice that this is due to two very large countries, which we assume are India and China:

```{r no-transformation, echo=FALSE}
p2 <- gapminder %>% filter(year == 2015) %>% 
  mutate(continent = reorder(continent, population, median)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(continent, population/10^6)) + 
  ylab("Population in Millions") +
  xlab("Continent")
p2 +  geom_jitter(width = .1, alpha = .5) 
```

Using a log transformation here provides a much more informative plot. We compare the original barplot to a boxplot using the log scale transformation for the y-axis:


```{r correct-transformation, out.width="100%", echo=FALSE, fig.height=3.5}
p2 <- p2 + geom_boxplot(coef=3) + 
  geom_jitter(width = .1, alpha = .5) + 
  scale_y_log10(breaks = c(1,10,100,1000)) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 7)) 
grid.arrange(p1, p2, ncol = 2)
```

With the new plot, we realize that countries in Africa actually have a larger median population size than those in Asia.

Other transformations you should consider are the logistic transformation (`logit`), useful to better see fold changes in odds, and the square root transformation (`sqrt`), useful for count data.

---

### 5.8.1 Compared Visual Cues Should Be Adjacent

For each continent, let's compare income in 1970 versus 2010. When comparing income data across regions between 1970 and 2010, we made a figure similar to the one below, but this time we investigate continents rather than regions.

```{r boxplots-not-adjacent, echo=FALSE}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(year %in% c(1970, 2010) & !is.na(gdp)) %>%
  mutate(dollars_per_day = gdp/population/365) %>%
  mutate(labels = paste(year, continent)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(labels, dollars_per_day)) +
  geom_boxplot() + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) +
  scale_y_continuous(trans = "log2") + 
  ylab("Income in dollars per day")
```


The default in __ggplot2__ is to order labels alphabetically so the labels with 1970 come before the labels with 2010, making the comparisons challenging because a continent's distribution in 1970 is visually far from its distribution in 2010. It is much easier to make the comparison between 1970 and 2010 for each continent when the boxplots for that continent are next to each other:

```{r boxplot-adjacent-comps, echo=FALSE}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(year %in% c(1970, 2010) & !is.na(gdp)) %>%
  mutate(dollars_per_day = gdp/population/365) %>%
  mutate(labels = paste(continent, year)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(labels, dollars_per_day)) +
  geom_boxplot() + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) +
  scale_y_continuous(trans = "log2") + 
  ylab("Income in dollars per day")
```

---

### Use color 

The comparison becomes even easier to make if we use color to denote the two things we want to compare: 


```{r boxplot-adjacent-comps-with-color, echo=FALSE}
 gapminder %>% 
  filter(year %in% c(1970, 2010) & !is.na(gdp)) %>%
  mutate(dollars_per_day = gdp/population/365, year = factor(year)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(continent, dollars_per_day, fill = year)) +
  geom_boxplot() + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) +
  scale_y_continuous(trans = "log2") + 
  ylab("Income in dollars per day")
```


### Think of the color blind

About 10% of the population is color blind. Unfortunately, the default colors used in __ggplot2__ are not optimal for this group. However, __ggplot2__ does make it easy to change the color palette used in the plots. An example of how we can use a color blind friendly palette is described here: [http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/Colors_(ggplot2)/#a-colorblind-friendly-palette](http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/Colors_(ggplot2)/#a-colorblind-friendly-palette):

```{r, eval=FALSE}
color_blind_friendly_cols <- 
  c("#999999", "#E69F00", "#56B4E9", "#009E73", 
    "#F0E442", "#0072B2", "#D55E00", "#CC79A7")
```

Here are the colors
```{r color-blind-friendly-colors, echo=FALSE, fig.height=0.5}
color_blind_friendly_cols <- 
  c("#999999", "#E69F00", "#56B4E9", "#009E73", 
    "#F0E442", "#0072B2", "#D55E00", "#CC79A7")

p1 <- data.frame(x=1:8, y=rep(1,8), col = as.character(1:8)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x, y, color = col)) + 
  geom_point(size=8, show.legend = FALSE) +
  theme(axis.title.x=element_blank(),
        axis.text.x=element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.x=element_blank(),
        axis.title.y=element_blank(),
        axis.text.y=element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.y=element_blank(),
        panel.grid.major = element_blank(), 
        panel.grid.minor = element_blank())

p1 + scale_color_manual(values=color_blind_friendly_cols)
```

There are several resources that can help you select colors, for example this one: [http://bconnelly.net/2013/10/creating-colorblind-friendly-figures/](http://bconnelly.net/2013/10/creating-colorblind-friendly-figures/).

### 5.2 Assessment: Data Visualization Principles, Part 2

### 5.9 Plots for two variables

In general, you should use scatterplots to visualize the relationship between two variables.
In every single instance in which we have examined the relationship between two variables, including total murders versus population size, life expectancy versus fertility rates, and infant mortality versus income, we have used scatterplots. This is the plot we generally recommend. However, there are some exceptions and we describe two alternative plots here: the _slope chart_ and the _Bland-Altman plot_.

### Slope Charts

One exception where another type of plot may be more informative is when you are comparing variables of the same type, but at different time points and for a relatively small number of comparisons. For example, comparing life expectancy between 2010 and 2015. In this case, we might recommend a _slope chart_. 

There is no geometry for slope charts in __ggplot2__, but we can construct one using `geom_line`. We need to do some tinkering to add labels. Below is an example comparing 2010 to 2015 for large western countries:

```{r slope-plot}
west <- c("Western Europe","Northern Europe","Southern Europe",
          "Northern America","Australia and New Zealand")

dat <- gapminder %>% 
  filter(year%in% c(2010, 2015) & region %in% west & 
           !is.na(life_expectancy) & population > 10^7) 

dat %>%
  mutate(location = ifelse(year == 2010, 1, 2), 
         location = ifelse(year == 2015 & 
                             country %in% c("United Kingdom", "Portugal"),
                           location+0.22, location),
         hjust = ifelse(year == 2010, 1, 0)) %>%
  mutate(year = as.factor(year)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(year, life_expectancy, group = country)) +
  geom_line(aes(color = country), show.legend = FALSE) +
  geom_text(aes(x = location, label = country, hjust = hjust), 
            show.legend = FALSE) +
  xlab("") + ylab("Life Expectancy")
```

An advantage of the slope chart is that it permits us to quickly get an idea of changes based on the slope of the lines. Although we are using angle as the visual cue, we also have position to determine the exact values. Comparing the improvements is a bit harder with a scatterplot:


```{r scatter-plot-instead-of-slope, echo=FALSE}
library(ggrepel)
west <- c("Western Europe","Northern Europe","Southern Europe",
          "Northern America","Australia and New Zealand")

dat <- gapminder %>% 
  filter(year%in% c(2010, 2015) & region %in% west & 
           !is.na(life_expectancy) & population > 10^7) 

dat %>% 
  mutate(year = paste0("life_expectancy_", year)) %>%
  select(country, year, life_expectancy) %>%
  spread(year, life_expectancy) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=life_expectancy_2010,y=life_expectancy_2015, label = country)) + 
  geom_point() + geom_text_repel() +
  scale_x_continuous(limits=c(78.5, 83)) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits=c(78.5, 83)) +
  geom_abline(lty = 2) +
  xlab("2010") + 
  ylab("2015")
```

In the scatterplot, we have followed the principle _use common axes_ since we are comparing these before and after. However, if we have many points, slope charts stop being useful as it becomes hard to see all the lines.

---

### Bland-Altman plot

Since we are primarily interested in the difference, it makes sense to dedicate one of our axes to it. The Bland-Altman plot, also known as the Tukey mean-difference plot and the MA-plot, shows the difference versus the average:

```{r, bland-altman}
library(ggrepel)
dat %>% 
  mutate(year = paste0("life_expectancy_", year)) %>%
  select(country, year, life_expectancy) %>% 
  spread(year, life_expectancy) %>% 
  mutate(average = (life_expectancy_2015 + life_expectancy_2010)/2,
         difference = life_expectancy_2015 - life_expectancy_2010) %>%
  ggplot(aes(average, difference, label = country)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_text_repel() +
  geom_abline(lty = 2) +
  xlab("Average of 2010 and 2015") + 
  ylab("Difference between 2015 and 2010")
```

Here, by simply looking at the y-axis, we quickly see which countries have shown the most improvement. We also get an idea of the overall value from the x-axis.

---

### 5.10 Encoding a Third Variable

An earlier scatterplot showed the relationship between infant survival and average income. Below is a version of this plot that encodes three variables: OPEC membership, region, and population.

```{r encoding-third-variable, echo=FALSE}
present_year <- 2010

dat <- gapminder %>%
  mutate(region = case_when(
    region %in% west ~ "The West",
    region %in% "Northern Africa" ~ "Northern Africa",
    region %in% c("Eastern Asia", "South-Eastern Asia") ~ "East Asia",
    region == "Southern Asia"~ "Southern Asia",
    region %in% c("Central America", "South America", "Caribbean") ~ "Latin America",
    continent == "Africa" & region != "Northern Africa" ~ "Sub-Saharan Africa",
    region %in% c("Melanesia", "Micronesia", "Polynesia") ~ "Pacific Islands"),
    dollars_per_day = gdp / population / 365) %>%
  filter(year %in% present_year & !is.na(gdp) & !is.na(infant_mortality) & !is.na(region) ) %>%
  mutate(OPEC = ifelse(country%in%opec, "Yes", "No")) 

dat %>% 
  ggplot(aes(dollars_per_day, 1 - infant_mortality/1000, 
             col = region, size = population/10^6,
             pch =  OPEC)) +
  scale_x_continuous(trans = "log2", limits=c(0.25, 150)) +
  scale_y_continuous(trans = "logit",limit=c(0.875, .9981),
                     breaks=c(.85,.90,.95,.99,.995,.998)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  ylab("Infant survival proportion")
```

---

We encode categorical variables with color and shape. These shapes can be controlled with `shape`  argument. Below are the shapes available for use in R. For the last five, the color goes inside.

```{r available-shapes, echo=FALSE, fig.height=2.25}
dat=data.frame(x=c(0:25))
ggplot() +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.title.x=element_blank(),
        axis.text.x=element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.x=element_blank(),
        axis.title.y=element_blank(),
        axis.text.y=element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.y=element_blank(),
        panel.grid.major = element_blank(), 
        panel.grid.minor = element_blank()) +
scale_shape_identity() + scale_y_reverse() +
geom_point(dat, mapping=aes(x%%9, x%/%9, shape=x), size=4, fill="blue") +
geom_text(dat, mapping=aes(x%%9, x%/%9+0.25, label=x), size=4) 
```

---

For continuous variables, we can use color, intensity, or size. We now show an example of how we do this with a case study.

When selecting colors to quantify a numeric variable, we choose between two options: sequential and diverging. Sequential colors are suited for data that goes from high to low.  High values are clearly distinguished from low values. Here are some examples offered by the package `RColorBrewer`:

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(RColorBrewer)
display.brewer.all(type="seq")
```

```{r r-color-brewer-seq, fig.height=3.5, echo=FALSE}
library(RColorBrewer)
rafalib::mypar()
display.brewer.all(type="seq")
```

---

Diverging colors are used to represent values that diverge from a center. We put equal emphasis on both ends of the data range: higher than the center and lower than the center. An example of when we would use a divergent pattern would be if we were to show height in standard deviations away from the average. Here are some examples of divergent patterns:

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(RColorBrewer)
display.brewer.all(type="div")
```


```{r r-color-brewer-div, fig.height=2.5, echo=FALSE}
library(RColorBrewer)
rafalib::mypar()
display.brewer.all(type="div")
```

### 5.11 Case Study: Vaccines

Vaccines have helped save millions of lives. In the 19th century, before herd immunization was achieved through vaccination programs, deaths from infectious diseases, such as smallpox and polio, were common. However, today vaccination programs have become somewhat controversial despite all the scientific evidence for their importance.

The controversy started with a [paper](http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(97)11096-0/abstract) published in 1988 and led by Andrew Wakefield claiming 
there was a link between the administration of the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine and the appearance of autism and bowel disease. 
Despite much scientific evidence contradicting this finding, sensationalist media reports and fear-mongering from conspiracy theorists led parts of the public into believing that vaccines were harmful. As a result, many parents ceased to vaccinate their children. This dangerous practice can be potentially disastrous given that the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimates that vaccinations will prevent more than 21 million hospitalizations and 732,000 deaths among children born in the last 20 years (see [Benefits from Immunization during the Vaccines for Children Program Era — United States, 1994-2013, MMWR](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6316a4.htm)). 
The 1988 paper has since been retracted and Andrew Wakefield was eventually "struck off the UK medical register, with a statement identifying deliberate falsification in the research published in The Lancet, and was thereby barred from practicing medicine in the UK." (source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Wakefield)). Yet misconceptions persist, in part due to self-proclaimed activists who continue to disseminate misinformation about vaccines. 

Effective communication of data is a strong antidote to misinformation and fear-mongering. Earlier we used an example provided by a [Wall Street Journal article](http://graphics.wsj.com/infectious-diseases-and-vaccines/) showing data related to the impact of vaccines on battling infectious diseases.  Here we reconstruct that example.

The data used for these plots were collected, organized, and distributed by the [Tycho Project](http://www.tycho.pitt.edu/). They include weekly reported counts for seven diseases from 1928 to 2011, from all fifty states. We include the yearly totals in the __dslabs__ package:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(dslabs)
data(us_contagious_diseases)
names(us_contagious_diseases)
```

---

We create a temporary object `dat` that stores only the measles data, includes a per 100,000 rate, orders states by average value of disease and removes Alaska and Hawaii since they only became states in the late 1950s. Note that there is a `weeks_reporting` column that tells us for how many weeks of the year data was reported. We have to adjust for that value when computing the rate.

```{r}
the_disease <- "Measles"
dat <- us_contagious_diseases %>%
  filter(!state%in%c("Hawaii","Alaska") & disease == the_disease) %>%
  mutate(rate = count / population * 10000 * 52 / weeks_reporting) %>% 
  mutate(state = reorder(state, rate)) 
```

We can now easily plot disease rates per year. Here are the measles data from California:

```{r california-measles-time-series}
dat %>% filter(state == "California" & !is.na(rate)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(year, rate)) +
  geom_line() + 
  ylab("Cases per 10,000")  + 
  geom_vline(xintercept=1963, col = "blue")
```

We add a vertical line at 1963 since this is when the vaccine was introduced [Control, Centers for Disease; Prevention (2014). CDC health information for international travel 2014 (the yellow book). p. 250. ISBN 9780199948505]. 

---

Now can we show data for all states in one plot? We have three variables to show: year, state, and rate. In the WSJ figure, they use the x-axis for year, the y-axis for state, and color hue to represent rates. However, the color scale they use, which goes from yellow to blue to green to orange to red, can be improved.  

In our example, we want to use a sequential palette since there is no meaningful center, just low and high rates.

---

We use the geometry `geom_tile` to tile the region with colors representing disease rates. We use a square root transformation to avoid having the really high counts dominate the plot. Notice that missing values are shown in grey. Note that once a disease was pretty much eradicated, some states stopped reporting cases all together. This is why we see so much grey after 1980.

```{r vaccines-plot, out.width="100%", fig.height=5}
dat %>% ggplot(aes(year, state, fill = rate)) +
  geom_tile(color = "grey50") +
  scale_x_continuous(expand=c(0,0)) +
  scale_fill_gradientn(colors = brewer.pal(9, "Reds"), trans = "sqrt") +
  geom_vline(xintercept=1963, col = "blue") +
  theme_minimal() +  
  theme(panel.grid = element_blank(), 
        legend.position="bottom", 
        text = element_text(size = 8)) +
  ggtitle(the_disease) + 
  ylab("") + xlab("")
```

---

This plot makes a very striking argument for the contribution of vaccines. However, one limitation of this plot is that it uses color to represent quantity, which we earlier explained makes it harder to know exactly how high values are going. Position and lengths are better cues. If we are willing to lose state information, we can make a version of the plot that shows the values with position. We can also show the average for the US, which we compute like this:

```{r}
avg <- us_contagious_diseases %>%
  filter(disease==the_disease) %>% group_by(year) %>%
  summarize(us_rate = sum(count, na.rm = TRUE) / 
              sum(population, na.rm = TRUE) * 10000)
```

Now to make the plot we simply use the `geom_line` geometry:
```{r time-series-vaccines-plot}
dat %>% 
  filter(!is.na(rate)) %>%
    ggplot() +
  geom_line(aes(year, rate, group = state),  color = "grey50", 
            show.legend = FALSE, alpha = 0.2, size = 1) +
  geom_line(mapping = aes(year, us_rate),  data = avg, size = 1) +
  scale_y_continuous(trans = "sqrt", breaks = c(5, 25, 125, 300)) + 
  ggtitle("Cases per 10,000 by state") + 
  xlab("") + ylab("") +
  geom_text(data = data.frame(x = 1955, y = 50), 
            mapping = aes(x, y, label="US average"), 
            color="black") + 
  geom_vline(xintercept=1963, col = "blue")
```

In theory, we could use color to represent the categorical value state, but it is hard to pick 50 distinct colors.

### 5.12 Avoid Pseudo and Gratuitous 3D Plots

The figure below, taken from the [scientific literature](https://projecteuclid.org/download/pdf_1/euclid.ss/1177010488),
shows three variables: dose, drug type and survival. Although your screen/book page is flat and two-dimensional, the plot tries to imitate three dimensions and assigned a dimension to each variable.

  </figure>

Humans are not good at seeing in three dimensions (which explains why it is hard to parallel park) and our limitation is even worse with regard to pseudo-three-dimensions. To see this, try to determine the values of the survival variable in the plot above. Can you tell when the purple ribbon intersects the red one? This is an example in which we can easily use color to represent the categorical variable instead of using a pseudo-3D:

```{r colors-for-different-lines,  echo=FALSE}
##First read data
url <- "https://github.com/kbroman/Talk_Graphs/raw/master/R/fig8dat.csv"
dat <- read.csv(url)

##Now make alternative plot
dat %>% gather(drug, survival, -log.dose) %>%
  mutate(drug = gsub("Drug.","",drug)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(log.dose, survival, color = drug)) +
  geom_line()    
```

Notice how much easier it is to determine the survival values. 

Pseudo-3D is sometimes used completely gratuitously: plots are made to look 3D even when the 3rd dimension does not represent a quantity. This only adds confusion and makes it harder to relay your message.  Here are two examples:


  <center>
   
  <figure>
  <img src="./images/fig1e.png" alt="R Studio" style="width:400px">
  </figure> 
  
  </center>

### 5.13 Avoid Too Many Significant Digits

By default, statistical software like R returns many significant digits. The default behavior in R is to show 7 significant digits. That many digits often adds no information and the added visual clutter can make it hard for the viewer to understand the message. As an example, here are the per 10,000 disease rates, computed from totals and population in R, for California across the five decades:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
data(us_contagious_diseases)
tmp <- options()$digits
options(digits=7)
dat <- us_contagious_diseases %>%
  filter(year %in% seq(1940, 1980, 10) &  state == "California" &
          disease %in% c("Measles", "Pertussis", "Polio")) %>%
  mutate(rate = count / population * 10000) %>% 
  mutate(state = reorder(state, rate)) %>% 
  select(state, year, disease, rate) %>%
  spread(disease, rate)
if(knitr::is_html_output()){
  knitr::kable(dat, "html") %>%
    kableExtra::kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = FALSE)
} else{
  knitr::kable(dat, "latex", booktabs = TRUE) %>%
    kableExtra::kable_styling(font_size = 8)
}
options(digits=tmp)
```

We are reporting precision up to 0.00001 cases per 10,000, a very small value in the context of the changes that are occurring across the dates. In this case, two significant figures is more than enough and clearly makes the point that rates are decreasing:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
dat <- dat %>% 
  mutate_at(c("Measles", "Pertussis", "Polio"), ~round(., digits=1))
if(knitr::is_html_output()){
  knitr::kable(dat, "html") %>%
    kableExtra::kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = FALSE)
} else{
  knitr::kable(dat, "latex", booktabs = TRUE) %>%
    kableExtra::kable_styling(font_size=8)
}
```

Useful ways to change the number of significant digits or to round numbers are `signif` and `round`. You can define the number of significant digits globally by setting options like this: `options(digits = 3)`. 


Another principle related to displaying tables is to place values being compared on columns rather than rows. Note that our table above is easier to read than this one:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
dat <- us_contagious_diseases %>%
  filter(year %in% seq(1940, 1980, 10) &  state == "California" &
          disease %in% c("Measles", "Pertussis", "Polio")) %>%
  mutate(rate = count / population * 10000) %>% 
  mutate(state = reorder(state, rate)) %>% 
  select(state, year, disease, rate) %>%
  spread(year, rate) %>% 
  mutate_if(is.numeric, round, digits=1) 
if(knitr::is_html_output()){
  knitr::kable(dat, "html") %>%
    kableExtra::kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = FALSE)
} else{
  knitr::kable(dat, "latex", booktabs = TRUE) %>%
    kableExtra::kable_styling(font_size = 8)
}
```

### 5.14 Know your audience

Graphs can be used for 1) our own exploratory data analysis, 2) to convey a message to experts, or 3) to help tell a story to a general audience. Make sure that the intended audience understands each element of the plot. 

As a simple example, consider that for your own exploration it may be more useful to log-transform data and then plot it. However, for a general audience that is unfamiliar with converting logged values back to the original measurements, using a log-scale for the axis instead of log-transformed values will be much easier to digest.
