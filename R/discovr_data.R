#'
#' AC/DC are one one of the best-selling hard rock bands in history, with around 100 million certified sales, and an estimated 200 million actual sales.
#' In 1980 their original singer Bon Scott died of alcohol poisoning and choking on his own vomit. He was replaced by Brian Johnson who has been their singer ever since.
#' Debate rages with unerring frequency within the rock music press over who is the better frontman. The conventional wisdom is that Bon Scott was better although personally, and I seem to be somewhat in the minority here, I prefer Brian Johnson.
#' Anyway, Robert Oxoby in a playfull paper decided to put this argument to bed once and for all (Oxoby, 2008).
#' Using a task from experimental economics called the ultimatum game, individuals are assigned the role of either proposer or responder and paired randomly.
#' Proposers are allocated $10 from which they have to make a financial offer to the responder (i.e., $2). The responder can accept or reject this offer. If the offer is rejected neither party gets any money,
#' but if the offer is accepted the responder keeps the offered amount (e.g., $2), and the proposer keeps the original amount minus what they offered (e.g., $8). For half of the participants the song
#' ‘It’s a long way to the top’ sung by Bon Scott was playing in the background, for the remainder ‘Shoot to thrill’ sung by Brian Johnson was playing. Oxoby measured the offers made by proposers,
#' and the minimum offers that responders accepted (called the minimum acceptable offer). He reasoned that people would accept lower offers and propose higher offers when listening to something they like
#' (because of the ‘feel-good factor’ the music creates). Therefore, by comparing the value of offers made and the minimum acceptable offers in the two groups he could see whether people have more of a feel
#' good factor when listening to Bon or Brian. There were 18 people per group.
#'
#' These data are approximated from graphs within Oxoby (2008). The object contains the following variables:
#'
#'   * **singer**: the type of teaching method used
#'   * **offer**: offer made (in dollars)
#'   * **mao**: the minimum acceptable offer, MAO, in dollars

#' A dataset from Field, A. P. (2020). Discovering statistics using R and RStudio (2nd ed.). London: Sage.
#'
#' During my psychology degree I spent a lot of time reading about the civil rights movement in the USA. Instead of reading psychology,
#' I read about Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr. For this reason I find Beckham’s 1929 study of black Americans
#' a fascinating historical piece of research. Beckham was a black American who founded the psychology laboratory
#' at Howard University, Washington, DC and his wife Ruth was the first black woman ever to be awarded a PhD
#' (also in psychology) at the University of Minnesota. To put some context on the study, it was published
#' 36 years before the Jim Crow laws were finally overthrown by the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and in a time when
#' black Americans were segregated, openly discriminated against and victims of the most abominable violations of
#' civil liberties and human rights (I recommend James Baldwin’s superb The fire next time for an insight into the times).
#' The language of the study and the data from it are an uncomfortable reminder of the era in which it was conducted.
#'
#' Beckham sought to measure the psychological state of 3443 black Americans with three questions. He asked them to
#' answer yes or no to whether they thought black Americans were happy, whether they personally were happy as a black
#' American, and whether black Americans should be happy. Beckham did no formal statistical analysis of his data
#' (Fisher’s article containing the popularized version of the chi-square test was published only 7 years earlier
#' in a statistics journal that would not have been read by psychologists).
#' I love this study, because it demonstrates that you do not need elaborate methods to answer important and far-reaching questions;
#' with just three questions, Beckham told the world an enormous amount about very real and important psychological and sociological phenomena.
#' These are the data from that study. The data contains the following variables:
#'
#'
#'   * **profession**: Profession of respondents
#'   * **response**: response to the question as yes or no
#'   * **happy**: frequencies of reponses to a question about whether black Americans were happy

#' Bronstein et al. (2019) data
#'
#' A dataset from Field, A. P. (2020). Discovering statistics using R and RStudio (2nd ed.). London: Sage.
#'
#'  The rapid increase in ‘fake news’ and misinformation is a worrying trend in recent years.
#'  Perhaps more worrying is how widely some of this news is taken as fact. Researchers have started to look at what
#'  characteristics predict susceptibility to fake news. Bronstein et al. (2019) hypothesised that delusion-prone individuals
#'  may be more likely to believe fake news because of their tendency to engage in less analytic and open-minded thinking.
#'  They conducted two online studies that got merged into a single analysis to test this hypothesis. This object is a subset of variables from
#'  their data (I have changed the variable names to match the constructs measured rather than the scales used to measure them).
#'  The full dataset is available at [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jarmac.2018.09.005](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jarmac.2018.09.005).
#'
#'   * **id** (ResponseID in the original dataset): participant ID
#'   * **fake_newz** (ZBelief_Fake in the original dataset): participants viewed 12 fake news headlines, each with a brief description and photo, and rated their accuracy (1 = Not at all accurate, 4 = Very accurate). This variable is the average rating converted to a z-score.
#'   * **delusionz** (ZPDI_Total in the original dataset): Peter's et al Delusion Inventory (PDI), which uses statements such as “Do you ever feel as if there is a conspiracy against you?” to gauge a person’s propensity for delusion-like thinking. Again, scores were converted to z-scores.
#'   * **thinkz_open** (ZAOT_Total in the original dataset):  open minded thinking was assessed with the Actively Open-minded Thinking (AOT) scale, on which people endorse statements such as “A person should always consider new possibilities” using a six-point scale (1 = strongly disagree, 6 = strongly agree). The total score was again converted to z.
#'   * **thinkz_anal** (ZRF_Total in the original dataset): Analytic thinking was assessed using the Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT), which uses several problems that have intuitive-but-incorrect responses. Participants must override their intuition to get the correct answer. Over 7 items, higher scores (converted to z-scores again) indicate a greater tendency to use an analytic cognitive style.

#'
#' A dataset from Field, A. P. (2020). Discovering statistics using R and RStudio (2nd ed.). London: Sage.
#'
#' Some quail develop fetishes. Really. In studies where a terrycloth object acts as a sign that a mate will shortly
#' become available, some quail start to direct their sexuial behaviour towards the terrycloth object.
#' In evolutionary terms, this fetishistic behaviour seems counterproductive because sexual behaviour becomes directed
#' towards something that cannot provide reproductive success. However, perhaps this behaviour serves to prepare the
#' organism for the ‘real’ mating behaviour.
#'
#' Cetinkaya and Domjan (2006) sexually conditioned male quail.
#' All quail experienced the terrycloth stimulus and an opportunity to mate, but for some the terrycloth stimulus
#' immediately preceded the mating opportunity (paired group) whereas others experienced a 2-hour delay
#' (this acted as a control group because the terrycloth stimulus did not predict a mating opportunity).
#' In the paired group, quail were classified as fetishistic or not depending on whether they engaged in sexual
#' behaviour with the terrycloth object.
#'
#' During a test trial the quail mated with a female and the researchers measured the percentage of eggs fertilized,
#' the time spent near the terrycloth object, the latency to initiate copulation, and copulatory efficiency.
#' If this fetishistic behaviour provides an evolutionary advantage then we would expect the fetishistic quail to
#' fertilize more eggs, initiate copulation faster and be more efficient in their copulations.
#' These are the data from that study. The data contains the following variables:
#'
#'   * **groups**: The group to which each quail belonged (Fetishistics, NonFetishistics, or Control)

#' In a fascinating study, Tomas Chamorro-Premuzic and his colleagues (Chamorro-Premuzic, Furnham, Christopher, Garwood, & Martin, 2008)
#' tested the hypothesis that students tend to like lecturers who are like themselves. The authors measured students’ own personalities

#' from -5 (I don’t want this characteristic at all) through 0 (the characteristic is not important) to +5 (I really want this characteristic in my lecturer).
#' The characteristics were the same as those measured by the NEO-FFI. As such, the authors had a measure of how much a student had each of the

#'
#' Both Ozzy Osbourne and Judas Priest have been accused of putting backward masked messages on their albums
#' that subliminally influence poor unsuspecting teenagers into doing things like blowing their heads off with
#' shotguns. A psychologist was interested in whether backward masked messages could have an effect. He created
#' a version of Britney Spears’ ‘Baby one more time’ that contained the masked message ‘deliver your soul to the
#' dark lord’ repeated in the chorus. He took this version, and the original, and played one version (randomly)
#' to a group of 32 people. Six months later he played them whatever version they hadn’t heard the time before.
#' So, each person heard both the original and the version with the masked message, but at different points in time.

#' version. The (fictional) data contains the following variables:

#' It’s something of a wonder how evolution managed to produce such a monstrosity as the human penis.
#' One theory is sperm competition: the human penis has an unusually large glans (the ‘bell-end’) compared to other primates,
#' and this may have evolved so that the penis can displace seminal fluid from other males by ‘scooping it out’ during intercourse.
#' Armed with various devices from Hollywood Exotic Novelties, an artificial vagina from California Exotic Novelties, and some water and cornstarch
#' Gallup et al. (2003) put this theory to the test. They loaded the artificial vagina with 2.6 ml of fake sperm and inserted one
#' of three female sex toys into it before withdrawing it: a control phallus that had no coronal ridge (i.e., no bell-end),
#' a phallus with a minimal coronal ridge (small bell-end) and a phallus with a coronal ridge. They measured sperm displacement as a percentage:
#' 100% means that all the sperm was displaced, and 0% means that none of the sperm was displaced. If the human penis evolved as a sperm displacement
#' device then Gallup et al. predicted: (1) that having a bell-end would displace more sperm than not; and

#' Everyone likes a good gossip from time to time, but apparently it has an evolutionary function.
#' One school of thought is that gossip is used as a way to derogate sexual competitors – especially
#' by questioning their appearance and sexual behaviour. Apparently men rate gossiped-about women as
#' less attractive, and they are more influenced by the gossip if it came from a woman with a high mate value
#' (i.e. attractive and sexually desirable). Karlijn Massar and her colleagues hypothesized that if this theory
#' is true then (1) younger women will gossip more because there is more mate competation at younger ages; and

#' Social anxiety data
#'
#' A dataset from Field, A. P. (2020). Discovering statistics using R and RStudio (2nd ed.). London: Sage.
#'
#' Anxiety disorders take on different shapes and forms, and each disorder is believed to be distinct and have unique causes.
#' We can summarize the disorders and some popular theories as follows:
#'
#' * Social Anxiety: Social anxiety disorder is a marked and persistent fear of 1 or more social or performance situations in which the person is exposed to unfamiliar people or possible scrutiny by others. This anxiety leads to avoidance of these situations. People with social phobia are believed to feel elevated feelings of shame.
#' * Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD): OCD is characterized by the everyday intrusion into conscious thinking of intense, repetitive, personally abhorrent, absurd and alien thoughts (Obsessions), leading to the endless repetition of specific acts or to the rehearsal of bizarre and irrational mental and behavioural rituals (compulsions).
#'
#' Social anxiety and obsessive compulsive disorder are seen as distinct disorders having different causes. However, there are some similarities.
#' They both involve some kind of attentional bias: attention to bodily sensation in social anxiety and attention to things that could have negative consequences in OCD.
#' They both involve repetitive thinking styles: social phobics ruminate about social encounters after the event (known as post-event processing), and people with OCD
#' have recurring intrusive thoughts and images. They both involve safety behaviours (i.e. trying to avoid the thing that makes you anxious).
#'
#' This might lead us to think that, rather than being different disorders, they are manifestations of the same core processes (Field & Cartwright-Hatton, 2008). One way to research
#' this possibility would be to see whether social anxiety can be predicted from measures of other anxiety disorders. If social anxiety disorder and OCD are distinct we should expect
#' that measures of OCD will not predict social anxiety. However, if there are core processes underlying all anxiety disorders, then measures of OCD should predict social anxiety.
#' The data contains three variables:
#'
#'   * **spai**: The Social Phobia and Anxiety Inventory (SPAI), which measures levels of social anxiety.
#'   * **iii**: The Interpretation of Intrusions Inventory (III).
#'   * **obq**: Obsessive Beliefs Questionnaire (OBQ), which measures the degree to which people experience obsessive beliefs like those found in OCD.
#'   * **tosca**: The Test of Self-Conscious Affect (TOSCA), which measures shame.

#' naturally occurring in soya, was linked to lowered sperm counts in Western males. When you read the actual study,
#' it had been conducted on rats, it found no link to lowered sperm counts, but there was evidence of abnormal sexual
#' development in male rats (probably because genistein acts like oestrogen). As journalists tend to do, a study showing no
#' link between soya and sperm counts was used as the scientific basis for an article about soya being the cause of declining
#' sperm counts in Western males. Imagine the rat study was enough for us to want to test this idea in humans.
#' We recruit 80 males and split them into four groups that vary in the number of soya ‘meals’ (a dinner containing 75g of soya)

#'
#' Visceral factors that require us to engage in self control (such as a filling bladder) can affect our inhibtory
#' abilities in unrelated domains. In a fascinating study by Tuk, Trampe, and Warlop (2011) participants were given
#' five cups of water: one group was asked to drink them all, whereas another was asked to take a sip from each.
#' This manipulation led one group to have full bladders and the other group relatively empty (urgency).
#' Later on, these participants were given eight trials on which they had to choose between a small financial
#' reward that they would receive soon (SS) or a large financial reward for which they would wait longer (LL).
#' They counted how many trials participants choose the LL reward as an indicator of inhibitory control (ll_sum). The data contains three variables:
#'
#'   * **id**: participant ID
#'   * **urgency**: whether participants were in a high urination urgency condition (they drank everything) or a low urgency condition (they took sips of water)
#'   * **ll_sum**: the total number of LL rewards

#' experimentally, we could get six groups of people and strap a mobile phone on their heads, then by remote control
#' turn the phones on for a certain amount of time each day. After six months, we measure the size of any tumour (in mm^3)
#'  close to the site of the phone antenna (just behind the ear). The six groups experienced 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 hours per

#' Another predictor of aggression and conduct problems is callous-unemotional traits such as lack of guilt, lack of empathy, callous use of others for personal gain.

#' number of hours per week they play video games in 442 youths. These fictitious data contains three variables:
#'
#'   * **id**: participant ID

#' Statistics and maths anxiety are common and affect people’s performance on maths and stats assignments; women in particular can lack confidence in mathematics (Field, 2010).
#' Zhang, Schmader and Hall (2013) did an intriguing study in which students completed a maths test in which some put their own name on the test booklet,
#' whereas others were given a booklet that already had either a male or female name on. Participants in the latter two conditions were told that they would use this other person’s name for the purpose of the test.
#' Women who completed the test using a different name performed significantly better than those who completed the test using their own name. (There were no such significant effects for men.)
#' The data are a random subsample of Zhang et al.’s data with the following variables:
#'
#'   * **id**: participant ID
#'   * **sex**: participant's biological sex
#'   * **name_type**: the booklet condition to which the participant was allocated: Female fake name, Male fake name or Own name
